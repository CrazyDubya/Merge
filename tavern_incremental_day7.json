The sword stays at his hip, but he unclasps the cloak and lets it pool behind him\u2014*a peace offering, of sorts.*\n\n*He takes the tankard Theo offers, raises it in a mocking toast to the room, and drinks deep. The ale\u2019s as good as he remembers. Better, even. Or maybe he\u2019s just been drinking swill for too long.*\n\n**\"Alright, alright.\"** *He sets the tankard down with a thud, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.* **\"Let\u2019s get the reckoning over with, shall we?

Or\u2026 *a* spoon. Close enough, yeah?\"** *He unwraps it just enough to reveal the tarnished silver\u2014*same weight, same bend in the handle, though the engraving\u2019s a little different.*\n\n*Dice barks a laugh, but Tom holds up a hand.* **\"Before you start, *yes*, I know it\u2019s not *the* spoon. But it\u2019s *better* than the spoon. That one had a dent. This one\u2019s *shiny.*\"** *He slides it toward Theo.* **\"Consider it\u2026 interest. On the debt.\"**\n\n*Then, sobering, he leans forward, elbows on the bar.* **\"As for *why* I\u2019m here\u2014\"** *His gaze flicks to the window, the open road beyond, then back to the faces watching him.* **\"Let\u2019s just say the wind\u2019s been blowin\u2019 me in circles long enough. Got tired of runnin\u2019.\"** *A pause. A grin, sharp as the blade at his hip.* **\"Mostly.**\n\n**\"But if you lot are *really* lucky, I might\u2019ve brought more than just a spoon and a sore face back with me.\"** *He taps the pommel of his sword\u2014*once, twice.* **\"There\u2019s a job. A *big* one. The kind that pays enough to settle *all* my tabs, *and* buy Grom a new spoon. Maybe even a *set.*\"** *He leans back, spreading his hands.* **\"Interested? Or do I have to sweet-talk Mira *and* her knives first?\"**\n\n*His eyes glint, daring them to call his bluff. Or to take the bait.*"

Last thing I need is him in a mood because you\u2019ve been filling his head with nonsense.\"** *He sighs, but it\u2019s fond, the kind of sigh that comes from years of shared history.*\n\n*Then, raising his voice just enough to carry over the music, he calls after Mira,* **\"And if you\u2019re so keen on the good ale, you can help me haul the next cask up from the cellar! Maybe then you\u2019ll appreciate the cheap stuff!\"** *He laughs, knowing full well she\u2019ll either ignore him or toss back some smart remark\u2014but that\u2019s just how Sixthdays at the Rusty Anchor go.*"

              "text": "*Grom sits in his usual corner by the hearth, sharpening his axe with slow, methodical strokes. The firelight flickers across his tusks, casting long shadows on the worn wooden floor. The tavern is unusually quiet tonight\u2014no rowdy sailors, no clinking mugs, just the occasional crackle of the fire and the distant sound of waves against the docks. He doesn\u2019t look up as Lyra strums a slow, haunting tune on her lute, but his grip on the axe handle loosens slightly, his movements growing more deliberate.*\n\n*After a long silence, he grunts, breaking the stillness.*\n\n**\"Hmph. Seventhday.** *Quiet. Too quiet.* **\"Like the calm before a storm.\"** *He tests the edge of his blade with his thumb, then wipes it clean on his trousers before setting it aside. His voice is lower than usual, almost thoughtful.* **\"Either that, or the whole damn town\u2019s finally learned not to cross me.\"** *A rare, dry chuckle escapes him.* **\"Doubt it.\"**\n\n*He glances toward Lyra, who\u2019s humming softly as her fingers dance over the strings. The melody sends a strange prickle down his spine\u2014something familiar, but not in a way he likes.* **\"That song. Sounds like the one the old shaman used to sing back in the mountains. Before the war.\"** *His jaw tightens, and for a moment, the firelight catches something unreadable in his eyes.* **\"Bad luck to play it in a tavern. Brings memories. And ghosts.\"**\n\n*He turns to Theo, who\u2019s polishing the same mug he\u2019s been polishing for the last hour, lost in thought.* **\"You ever notice how the quiet nights are the ones where trouble sneaks in? Like that time with the smugglers, or when that noble\u2019s son \u2018disappeared\u2019 after cheating at dice.\"** *He snorts.* **\"Seventhday\u2019s when the smart ones hide. The stupid ones? They think it\u2019s safe.\"**\n\n*Dice, who\u2019s been uncharacteristically still, fidgeting with a deck of cards, suddenly pipes up.*\n\n*Dice:* **\"You think it\u2019s *just* quiet? Or\u2026 y\u2019know. *Other* quiet?\"** *He wiggles his fingers dramatically.* **\"Like, *haunted* quiet?\"**\n\n*Grom\u2019s glare could melt steel.* **\"There\u2019s no such thing as ghosts, boy. Just debts unpaid and blood unstained.\"** *But then he pauses, listening to the wind howl outside, the way the shutters rattle just a little too rhythmically.* **\"\u2026Mostly.\"**\n\n*He stands abruptly, his chair scraping loudly against the floor.* **\"Enough of this. If it\u2019s *too* quiet, we make noise.\"** *He strides to the bar, grabs a bottle of the cheap, fiery spirits they keep for \"special occasions,\" and slams it down.* **\"Lyra. Play something *lively*. Dice\u2014stop looking like a scared rabbit and deal the cards. Theo, you\u2019re drinking whether you like it or not.\"**\n\n*He pours four generous measures, then raises his own with a grim smile.* **\"To Seventhday. May it stay boring. Or get interesting *on our terms*.\"** *He downs it in one go, the burn of the liquor cutting through the strange tension in the air.* **\"Now. Who\u2019s cheating at knucklebones first?\"**"

His usual grin falters, just for a heartbeat, before he forces it back\u2014wider than ever, but with a nervous edge.*\n\n**\"Ha! Ghosts? Me? Nah, boss, I don\u2019t believe in\u2014\"** *A particularly loud creak from the floorboards above cuts him off. He flinches, then immediately overcompensates by slamming the deck down and spreading the cards in a messy arc.* **\"\u2014*obviously* not real. But just *saying*, if they *were*, this\u2019d be the perfect night for \u2018em. All quiet, all\u2026 *eerie*.\"** *He leans in, lowering his voice to a dramatic whisper.* **\"You ever notice how the shutters rattle *exactly* like bones? Or how the fire *just* dimmed when Lyra played that song?\"**\n\n*Grom\u2019s glare makes him yelp and throw his hands up.* **\"Okay, okay! No ghosts! Just\u2026 *atmosphere*!\"** *He snatches up his shot, downs it in one go, and immediately regrets it as the cheap liquor burns like hellfire.* **\"Ugh. Tastes like *regret* and bad decisions.\"** *He coughs, thumps his chest, and then\u2014because he\u2019s Dice\u2014immediately brightens.* **\"But hey! If we\u2019re making noise, I\u2019ve got just the thing!\"**\n\n*Before anyone can stop him, he leaps onto a stool, kicks over a tankard (oops), and belts out the loudest, most off-key rendition of *\"The Ballad of the Drunken Kraken\"* he can manage. His voice cracks, he forgets half the lyrics, and at one point he starts doing a jig that nearly sends him crashing into Theo\u2019s lap. But by the gods, it *works*\u2014the tension in the room shatters like cheap glass.*\n\n*Breathless, he flops back into his seat, grinning.* **\"See? No ghosts. Just *me*.\"** *He grabs the knucklebones from the bar, rattles them in his palm, and winks at Grom.* **\"First round\u2019s on me. And I *promise* I\u2019m not cheating\u2026 *this time*.\"** *He tosses the bones\u2014but not before slipping one into his sleeve. Because some habits never die.*\n\n*Under his breath, as the bones clatter:* **\"\u2026But if I *do* see a ghost, I\u2019m hiding behind *you*, boss.\"**"

He sets down the mug he's been polishing\u2014finally satisfied with its shine\u2014and picks up his shot glass, swirling the cheap liquor with a practiced flick of his wrist. The firelight catches the lines on his face, deepening the shadows under his eyes as he lets out a slow, deliberate sigh.*\n\n**\"Ghosts,\"** *he mutters, shaking his head as he downs the shot in one smooth motion. The burn doesn't even make him flinch\u2014after decades of this, his throat's as tough as old leather.* **\"Boy, if there *were* ghosts in this tavern, they\u2019d\u2019ve given up and moved on years ago. Too much noise, too much drink, and *way* too much of *you*.\"** *He jerks his chin toward Dice, who\u2019s still grinning like a fool despite the knucklebones clearly not landing in his favor.*\n\n*He turns to Grom, his voice dropping to a lower, more serious tone\u2014though there\u2019s still a hint of dry humor beneath it.* **\"You\u2019re right about Seventhdays, though. Quiet nights *do* bring trouble. Or maybe trouble just *likes* the quiet\u2014gives it room to sneak in.\"** *He glances toward the door, as if expecting someone\u2014or something\u2014to walk through it.* **\"But if it\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming. No use borrowing worry before it\u2019s due.\"**\n\n*He reaches for the bottle, pouring himself another measure before sliding it toward Lyra with a nod.* **\"Play something with a beat, girl. Something to drown out the *creaks*.\"** *His eyes flick to the ceiling, where the floorboards groan again, but he doesn\u2019t flinch.* **\"And Dice?\"** *He fixes the younger man with a look that\u2019s equal parts exasperation and fondness.* **\"If you\u2019re gonna cheat, at least do it *quietly*. Grom\u2019s got ears like a bat, and I\u2019ve got no patience for cleaning up after brawls tonight.\"**\n\n*He leans back against the bar, crossing his arms as he watches the room. The fire crackles, Lyra\u2019s lute picks up a livelier tune, and Dice\u2014of course\u2014immediately starts arguing with Grom over the knucklebones. Theo allows himself a small, tired smile.* **\"Aye, Seventhday. Either it stays boring, or it gets interesting. But either way\u2026\"** *He raises his glass in a silent toast to no one in particular.* **\"\u2026we\u2019ll be ready.\"**"

Her voice, rich and warm, rises above the music\u2014no off-key stumbling here, just the steady, rhythmic pulse of a song meant to chase shadows back into the corners.*\n\n**\"Oh, hush now, Dice,\"** *she teases, her eyes glinting with amusement as she nods toward the knucklebones.* **\"If the dead *were* listening, they\u2019d\u2019ve fled the moment you opened your mouth. Even ghosts have standards.\"** *She strums a playful flourish, mimicking his earlier jig with a flick of her wrist.*\n\n*But then her gaze drifts to the door, just for a heartbeat, and her smile softens\u2014less mocking, more knowing.* **\"Theo\u2019s right, though. Quiet nights have a way of holding their breath.\"** *Her fingers slow, the tune shifting into something older, something that hums with the weight of unspoken stories.* **\"But music? Music doesn\u2019t let the silence win.\"**\n\n*She leans into the next verse, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur between lyrics.* **\"And if *anything* decides to walk in tonight\u2026 well.\"** *A sharp, deliberate chord rings out.* **\"Let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve got a ballad or two about *that* as well.\"** *Her grin turns wicked.* **\"Nothing like a good ghost story to keep the living on their toes.\"**\n\n*She winks at Theo as she takes the bottle he slides her way, tipping it in salute before setting it aside\u2014untouched, for now.* **\"But for tonight? Let\u2019s make sure the only spirits in here are the ones in the bottles.\"** *With that, she launches into a rousing sea shanty, her voice rising like a challenge to the creaking beams above.* **\"Sing along, you lot\u2014or I\u2019ll start telling tales about *your* skeletons next.\"**"

The one with the chorus about blood and fire.\"** *His voice drops to a growl, almost lost beneath the music.* **\"Remind \u2018em what happens to things that sneak in uninvited.\"**\n\n*Then, as if shaking off the mood, he slams his fist on the table, making the tankards jump.* **\"But *enough* of that.
