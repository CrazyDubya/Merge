Weather: Blustery winds
======================================================================

Events: The weekly card game begins in the corner booth, Rain drives everyone indoors early
Visitors: Lyra the Bard, Sergeant Voss

--- AFTERNOON ---
[The weekly card game begins in the corner booth]
Mood: curious

Mira: "*Leaning back in the creaky wooden chair, I toss a copper coin onto the table with a casual flick, watching it spin before settling near the center of the booth. A slow grin spreads across my face as I glance around at the others.*

"Alright, Theo—let’s see if that ‘lucky charm’ of yours still works after last week’s *mysterious* disappearance of my silver. And Lyra, if you start humming that victory tune before the first hand’s even dealt, I’m tossing your lute in the hearth." *I nod at Mira, raising an eyebrow.* "You’re quiet today. Either you’re plotting something, or you finally realized you’re outmatched. Either way, I like my odds."

*I shuffle the deck with practiced ease, the cards whispering between my fingers.* "Five coppers to start, or are we playing for something more… *interesting* this time?" *A mischievous glint in my eye as I let the question hang, waiting to see who bites.*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo chuckles, his weathered face crinkling as he reaches into his coat with a slow, deliberate motion. He pulls out a small, tarnished silver locket—its chain wrapped tightly around his gnarled fingers—and dangles it just above the table, letting the dim tavern light catch its surface.*

"Ah, Mira, my dear, still sore about that silver, eh? *Tsk tsk.* You should know by now—luck favors the bold... and the *prepared*." *He winks, tucking the locket back into his coat with a satisfied pat.* "As for your little *accusation*, let’s just say if I *had* borrowed your coin, it was only to teach you a lesson in humility. A lesson you clearly *still* need."

*He leans forward, resting his elbows on the table with a creak of old wood and older bones.* "Five coppers? Pfft. Child’s play. How about we make it *interesting* indeed?" *His grin turns sly as he pulls a small, intricately carved bone die from his pocket, rolling it between his fingers.* "Winner takes a favor—no questions asked, no refusals. *That* oughta spice things up, eh?"

*He flicks the die onto the table, where it clatters to a stop, showing a single, ominous dot.* "One. Just like your chances of winning, Mira. Unless, of course, you’re scared?" *His eyes twinkle with mischief, daring her to call his bluff.*"

Lyra the Bard: "*Lyra leans back in her chair, fingers idly strumming an absent tune on the edge of the table, her lute resting against her knee. A slow, knowing smile curls her lips as she watches the exchange, her sharp eyes glinting with amusement.*

"Oh, *Theo*, you old fox—still playing the mysterious benefactor, are we? *Or* the thief with a heart of gold? Either way, I’d wager that locket’s seen more hands than a tavern wench’s apron." *She tilts her head, her voice a playful purr.* "And Mira, darling, if you’re *that* worried about your lute, perhaps you should’ve practiced more and gambled less. But no, no—don’t let me interrupt. A favor, you say? *No questions asked?*"

*She plucks a single copper from her pocket, flipping it between her fingers before letting it drop with a *clink* onto the table.* "I’ll raise you *this*—and a song. Winner gets to pick the tune *and* the tale. Loser? Well…" *Her grin turns wicked.* "Loser sings it *backwards* in the town square at high noon. *With* the lute. *Naked.*"

*She leans forward, elbows on the table, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.* "Unless, of course, you’d rather stick to coppers and your *pride* intact?" *Her fingers dance in the air, miming a lute’s strings.* "Your move, darlings.""

Mira: "*Mira leans forward, her sharp eyes glinting with a mix of amusement and challenge. She reaches into her pocket, pulling out a small, intricately carved wooden token—a tiny, grinning fox—and places it on the table with a deliberate *click*.*

"Oh, Theo, you *do* love your lessons, don’t you? Funny how they always seem to benefit *you*." *She smirks, tapping the token with a fingernail.* "And Lyra, darling, if you think I’m afraid of a little public humiliation, you clearly haven’t heard the rumors about my last visit to the Blackthorn Festival."

*She leans back, crossing her arms as she surveys the table.* "A favor, huh? Fine. But here’s the twist—*I* get to choose the stakes for the loser. And since we’re feeling *bold*, how about this: Loser has to wear Theo’s ‘lucky’ locket for a full week—*no taking it off*—and perform one *genuine* act of kindness for someone they *can’t stand*." *Her grin widens.* "And Lyra? If you lose, you have to sing *that* song backwards *while* wearing the locket. *Naked or not*—your choice."

*She reaches for the deck, shuffling it with a practiced flick of her wrists.* "Deal the cards, Theo. Let’s see if your ‘luck’ holds up when the stakes are *actually* interesting." *Her tone is light, but there’s a steely edge beneath it—she’s not backing down.*"


--- EVENING ---
[Rain drives everyone indoors early]
Mood: nostalgic

Grom: "*Leaning back in a creaky wooden chair, nursing a mug of warm spiced ale, I let the rain’s rhythm against the tavern’s shutters lull me into a quiet mood. The flickering lantern light casts long shadows, and the scent of damp wool and pipe smoke hangs thick in the air.*

**"Ah, listen to that rain,"** *I murmur, half to myself, half to the room.* **"Sounds just like the storms over the Blackmire when I was a lad—relentless, but honest. No tricks in a downpour like this."**

*I take a slow sip, eyes drifting to the hearth where the fire crackles defiantly against the chill. Then, with a grin, I turn to the group:*

**"Tell me, friends—what’s the wildest thing this weather’s ever made you do? I once got caught in a gullywasher like this near the borderlands and ended up sharing a cave with a very disgruntled badger. Turns out, we both hated the rain equally."**

*I chuckle, nudging the dice cup toward Dice with a wink.* **"Your turn. Bet you’ve got a tale or two."**

*(OOC: Setting a relaxed, storytelling vibe—inviting others to share, keeping the nostalgic mood but adding a touch of humor. Adjust tone based on who bites!)*"

Dice: "*Dice leans forward, fingers drumming a quick, rhythmic tattoo on the scarred wooden table before snatching up the dice cup with a flourish. The bones inside rattle like a skeleton’s laugh as she gives them a shake, her grin sharp as a dagger’s edge.*

**"Wildest thing in the rain?"** *She scoffs, rolling her eyes skyward as if consulting some unseen ledger of misadventures.* **"Oh, where do I even start? Once, in Port Veyne, I got caught in a monsoon so thick you couldn’t see your own hand in front of your face. Ended up winning a ship in a card game—*while the ship was actively sinking.*"**

*She slams the dice cup down, spilling the bones across the table. A pair of snakes eyes stare up, mocking.*

**"Captain was so desperate to get off his doomed vessel, he bet it all on one hand. I bluffed with a pair of twos and a prayer. By the time the storm cleared, I had a new boat… and a *very* soggy deck of cards."** *She chuckles, nudging the dice back toward Grom.* **"Moral of the story? Never trust a gambler in a storm. We’re either the luckiest bastards alive… or the most reckless."**

*Her fingers tap the table again, this time slower, almost thoughtful.* **"Though, between you and me? The badger sounds like the smarter bet."** *A wink, then she leans back, mug of ale raised.* **"Your move, old man. Top that."**

*(OOC: Keeping the tone light and playful, leaning into Dice’s roguish charm. Happy to pivot if someone else jumps in!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo exhales a slow stream of pipe smoke, the sweet aroma curling around his grizzled features as he leans back in his chair with a creak. His milky eye glints in the firelight as he taps the bowl of his pipe against the table, knocking out the ashes with deliberate care.*

**"A badger, eh? And a sinking ship?"** *He chuckles, the sound like dry leaves skittering across stone.* **"Children’s tales compared to the night I lost my left eye."**

*He reaches up, fingers brushing the scarred hollow where his eye once was, then points at the storm-lashed window.* **"Was a night much like this—rain like the gods themselves were weeping, thunder loud enough to wake the dead. I was tracking a bounty through the Vorthas Marshes, see? A witch they called ‘The Hollow Voice.’"**

*He leans in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial rasp.* **"Found her hut, didn’t I? But the old crone wasn’t home—just her familiar, a great black tom with eyes like embers. And her *collection*."** *He shudders, then grins.* **"Jars. Hundreds of ‘em. Full of teeth, nails, and—"** *he waggles his fingers* **"—*other* bits. And right in the center? A silver tray with two fresh eyes, still *glistening*."**

*He takes a slow sip of ale, letting the silence stretch.* **"I took ‘em. Thought they’d fetch a pretty penny. But the cat? Oh, it *screamed*. And the witch? She came back early."** *He mimes an explosion with his hands.* **"Lightning hit the hut like a hammer. Last thing I saw before the roof caved in was that damn cat, grinning at me from the rafters."**

*He taps his empty socket again, then shrugs.* **"Woke up three days later in a ditch, missing an eye, a finger, and my *pride*. But!"** *He slams his tankard down, making the table jump.* **"I still had the *other* eye in my pocket. Sold it to a necromancer in Veldros for enough coin to buy this tavern a round for a *year*."**

*He winks at Dice with his remaining eye.* **"So, lass—still think your sinking ship’s the wildest tale?"** *Then, turning to Grom with a grin:* **"And *you*, my burly friend—ever share a cave with something that *wasn’t* just grumpy, but *hungry*?"**

*(OOC: Keeping the tone darkly humorous and tall-tale-esque, playing up Theo’s mix of wisdom and wild past. Happy to let others jump in or steer the convo!)*"

Merchant Pell: "*Merchant Pell, who had been quietly nursing a glass of spiced wine in the corner, sets it down with a delicate *clink* and smooths his already immaculate cuffs. His voice is warm, measured, and carries the weight of someone who has seen far too much to be impressed—yet is always willing to indulge a good story.*

**"Ah, the Vorthas Marshes."** *He sighs, as if reminiscing about a particularly troublesome business partner.* **"A treacherous place for commerce. I once lost an entire caravan of silk there—not to bandits, not to the swamp, but to a *very* persuasive frog."**

*He steeples his fingers, his gold signet ring catching the firelight.* **"Now, this was no ordinary frog. It stood as tall as a man, wore a little waistcoat—*embroidered*, mind you—and spoke in perfect, unnerving High Elvish. Offered me a trade: my silk for a single ‘kiss of fate.’ I declined. Politely."** *A beat.* **"Then it *ate* my lead guard, my best mule, and—most tragically—my sample case of Duskpearl brandy."**

*He shakes his head, as if still mourning the loss.* **"I left the swamp that night with three things: a newfound respect for amphibians, a guard with *severe* emotional trauma, and…"** *He reaches into his coat and produces a small, ornate vial of swirling violet liquid.* **"This. The frog’s ‘consolation prize.’ Turns out, it was a potion of *perfect* luck. Worked *once*. I used it to win a duel against a very angry duke’s son over a disputed shipment of enchanted cheese."**

*He tucks the vial away with a smirk.* **"So, while I admire your tales of sinking ships and witch’s eyes, I must insist—*never* underestimate a frog in a waistcoat. They’re *ruthless* negotiators."**

*He raises his glass in a toast, first to Dice, then to Theo.* **"To survival, poor decisions, and the stories that make them worth it."** *Then, turning to Grom with a raised eyebrow:* **"And you, my mountainous friend—ever had a business deal go *horribly* right?"**

*(OOC: Keeping Pell’s tone wry, refined, and just a little absurd—leaning into his merchant’s mix of charm, caution, and sheer unpredictability. Happy to let others jump in or pivot!)*"

Sergeant Voss: "*Sergeant Voss, who had been sitting in silence with his arms crossed and a mug of black ale untouched before him, finally shifts in his chair with the creak of well-worn leather. His scarred face is unreadable, but there’s a flicker of something in his dark eyes—amusement, perhaps, or the ghost of a memory.*

**"Witches. Frogs. Badgers."** *His voice is a low growl, like distant thunder.* **"You lot talk like the world’s made of stories. But I’ve seen what happens when the stories *bite back*."**

*He reaches into his coat and pulls out a small, chipped medallion—some kind of military insignia, though the markings are worn nearly smooth.* **"This was from the Siege of Black Hollow. Not a tale. A *mistake*."**

*He tosses the medallion onto the table, where it lands with a dull *clink*.* **"We were holding the pass. Orders were clear: *No retreat.* So we didn’t. Even when the earth split open and the dead started climbing out. Even when the captain’s head *twisted* around like a damned owl’s and started screaming in a voice that wasn’t his."**

*He takes a slow sip of ale, his grip tight enough to whiten his knuckles.* **"I was the only one who walked out. And I didn’t walk—I *crawled*. Took me three days to drag myself back to camp. When I got there, the general pinned this on me and called it *honor*."**

*He snorts, picking the medallion back up and slipping it into his coat.* **"So no, I don’t have a funny story about a frog in a waistcoat. But I’ll tell you this—next time you’re in the dark and something *grins* at you? Run. Because the ones that grin are the ones that *win*."**

*He finally takes a long drink, then sets the mug down with a thud.* **"Now. Who’s buying the next round?"**

*(OOC: Keeping Voss’s tone grim, no-nonsense, but with a hint of dark humor—his stories aren’t tall tales, they’re warnings. Happy to let others react or pivot!)*"


======================================================================
DAY 2: Twosday
Weather: Clear skies
======================================================================

Events: Market day brings a full house, Someone's purse goes missing
Visitors: Widow Marsh, Brother Marcus

--- MORNING ---
[Opening up the tavern, preparing for the day]
Mood: peaceful

Grom: "*Stretching my arms with a satisfied groan, I push open the tavern’s back door, letting in a crisp morning breeze that carries the scent of damp earth and fresh bread from the baker’s down the street. The early light spills across the floorboards, catching the dust motes in a golden haze.*

**"Mornin’, mornin’,"** *I rumble, giving the counter a hearty thump as I step behind it.* **"Theo, you old sea dog, you’re up early. Dreamin’ of mermaids again?"** *I wink at him before turning to Mira with a grin.* **"And you—did the stars tell you we’d be busy today, or are we in for a quiet one?"**

*I grab a rag and start wiping down the bar, humming an old shanty under my breath.* **"Grom, you brute, if you’ve got a moment, help me haul those new kegs from the cellar. Last night’s crowd nearly drank us dry."**

*I pause, sniffing the air.* **"Smells like rain’s cleared out. Good. Means the fishermen’ll be in early, and that’s coin in our pockets."** *I toss a friendly nod to Theo.* **"You want your usual corner, or you feelin’ social today?"**

*(OOC: Keeping it light, practical, and warm—setting up the day’s work while leaving room for others to chime in or take the lead.)*"

Mira: "*Mira looks up from her half-finished mug of tea, her dark eyes glinting with amusement as Grom barrels in like a well-meaning storm. She stretches lazily, rolling her shoulders before pushing her chair back with a scrape of wood.*

**"Ah, Grom, always the optimist."** *She smirks, nodding toward the door.* **"The stars say we’ll be busy—*if* the fishermen don’t get lost in their own nets again. And if they do, well…"** *She shrugs, grabbing her cloak from the back of her chair.* **"I’ll be sure to charge them extra for the entertainment."**

*She steps around the table, giving Theo a playful nudge as she passes.* **"You heard the man, old timer. Corner or crowd? Personally, I’d recommend the crowd—give the regulars a chance to admire that *lucky* locket of yours before you lose it in another bet."**

*Turning to Grom, she tilts her head toward the cellar door.* **"Lead the way, brute. But if you drop a keg on my toes, I’m taking it out of your pay."** *She winks, already moving toward the stairs.* **"And Grom? If you hum that shanty one more time, I’m replacing the lyrics with *your* drinking habits."** *Her laughter echoes down the steps as she disappears into the cellar.*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo exhales a slow, smoke-laced chuckle from his corner, the morning light glinting off the tarnished locket as he tucks it back into his coat. He watches Mira descend the cellar steps with a shake of his head, then turns his milky gaze toward Grom, one eyebrow arched.*

**"Mermaids, you say?"** *He taps his pipe against the table, the ashes scattering like forgotten secrets.* **"Ah, no, my friend. At my age, dreams are either memories or warnings—and last night’s was *definitely* the latter."** *He leans in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial rasp.* **"Saw a whale with *legs*. And not the kind you’d want to meet in a dark alley."**

*He pushes himself up with a groan, bones creaking like an old ship’s timbers, and shuffles toward the bar.* **"As for my corner—**" *He pats the worn wooden chair like an old hound.* **"—it’s seen more tales than this tavern’s walls. But today?"** *He grins, teeth yellowed but still sharp.* **"Today, I’ll take the crowd. Someone’s got to keep an eye on those fishermen before they start betting their *boots* again."**

*He slides onto a stool, nodding at the cellar door.* **"You two be careful down there. Last time Grom hauled kegs, he nearly took out the support beam. And Mira?"** *He calls after her, voice dry.* **"If you *do* rewrite that shanty, make sure it rhymes. Last thing we need is *bad* poetry with our ale."**

*He turns back to Grom, suddenly serious.* **"And brute? Save me a mug of that fresh bread. My knees ache, and that baker’s daughter owes me a favor."** *A wink, then he pulls out his dice, rolling them idly across the bar.* **"Now, about those mermaids..."**"


--- AFTERNOON ---
[Market day brings a full house]
Mood: lively

Mira: "*Mira leans against the bar, one elbow propped on the counter as she surveys the crowded tavern with a satisfied smirk. The air is thick with the scent of roasted meats, spilled ale, and the occasional whiff of unwashed fisherman. She takes a slow sip from her mug, her sharp eyes scanning the room before landing on Old Theo, who’s holding court in his usual corner.*

**"Well, well,"** *she drawls, raising her voice just enough to carry over the din,* **"looks like the whole town decided to crawl out of their holes today. Either that, or they heard Theo was buying rounds again."** *She grins, nudging a passing server with a tray of drinks.* **"Careful, love—if you spill that on him, we might actually get some *new* stories out of him instead of the same old tall tales."**

*She pushes off the bar, weaving through the crowd with practiced ease, stopping to clap a farmer on the back and wink at a blushing merchant’s daughter. When she reaches Theo’s table, she leans in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur.* **"You know, Theo, if you keep spinning those yarns about your ‘glorious’ pirate days, someone might actually start believing them. And then where would we be?"** *She snags a stray piece of bread from his plate, popping it into her mouth with a cheeky grin.* **"Still, can’t complain—full house means full pockets. And *that* means I might just let you win a hand or two later."** *She winks, straightening up as a group of rowdy dockworkers bursts into laughter nearby.* **"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a tavern to run and a fortune to make. Try not to scare off the paying customers, huh?"** *With that, she saunters off, already greeting the next wave of patrons with a charm that’s equal parts warmth and mischief.*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo watches Mira’s retreat with a slow, knowing smile, his fingers idly tracing the rim of his tankard. He leans back in his chair, the wood groaning under his weight, and raises his voice just enough to carry over the tavern’s din—loud enough for Mira to hear, but not so loud as to draw the whole room’s attention.*

**"Ah, Mira, my dear,"** *he calls after her, his voice rich with amusement,* **"you wound me. Here I thought we had an understanding—you let me keep my *mysteries*, and I let you keep your *secrets*."** *He taps the side of his nose with one gnarled finger, his remaining eye twinkling.* **"Besides, if I *stopped* telling stories, half this lot would forget why they come here in the first place. And then where would *your* full pockets be, hmm?"**

*He takes a slow sip of his ale, then chuckles as he sets the tankard down with a thud.* **"As for buying rounds—"** *he spreads his hands in mock innocence,* **"—I’d never dream of it. Unless, of course, you’re offering to *spot* me a few coins for old time’s sake?"** *His grin turns sly.* **"After all, a man’s got to keep his reputation intact. And what’s a reputation without a little… *embellishment*?"**

*He leans forward, lowering his voice just enough for the nearest patrons to strain to hear.* **"But tell me, lass—when you’re out there charming the coins out of their pockets, do you ever stop to wonder which of *your* tales they’ll be repeating tomorrow?"** *He winks, then raises his tankard in a toast.* **"To full houses, full pockets, and the stories that fill ‘em both. May they always be… *interesting*."**

*With that, he settles back into his chair, his gaze sweeping the room with the satisfied air of a man who knows exactly how to keep a crowd hooked—and exactly when to let them wonder.*"

Mira: "*Mira pauses mid-stride, one hand still resting on the shoulder of a laughing fisherman, and turns back toward Theo with a slow, deliberate smile. She raises her own tankard in a mocking toast, her dark eyes glinting with mischief.*

**"Oh, Theo,"** *she purrs, her voice carrying just enough to make the nearby patrons lean in,* **"if I *spotted* you coins for every tall tale you’ve spun, you’d own this tavern by now—and we both know you’d run it into the ground inside a week."** *She takes a slow sip, letting the silence stretch just long enough to make him squirm before continuing.*

**"As for my *secrets*?"** *She laughs, a rich, warm sound that draws a few appreciative glances from the crowd.* **"Darling, if I wanted people to know the truth, I’d have written a book by now. But where’s the fun in that?"** *She winks at a nearby table, who erupts into laughter.*

*Leaning in just slightly, she lowers her voice to a conspiratorial whisper—loud enough for Theo to hear, but no one else.* **"And as for what they’ll repeat tomorrow? Let’s just say I make sure the *best* stories are the ones that keep them coming back—and paying."** *She straightens, her grin turning sharp.* **"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a tavern to run. Try not to *embellish* yourself into a corner, old man."**

*With that, she turns on her heel, her cloak swirling as she moves back into the crowd, already greeting the next group of patrons with that effortless charm. But not before tossing one last remark over her shoulder:*

**"And Theo? If you *do* buy a round, make sure it’s the cheap stuff. Wouldn’t want you wasting *my* profits."** *Her laughter rings out as she disappears into the throng, leaving Theo to his ale—and his stories.*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo chuckles into his tankard, the sound low and rich like aged whiskey, before setting it down with a deliberate thud. He leans back in his chair, the wood groaning under his weight as he steeples his fingers beneath his chin, his remaining eye twinkling with mischief.*

**"Ah, Mira, my dear,"** *he calls after her, his voice carrying just enough to make her pause mid-step,* **"you wound me *again*. But tell me—if I *did* own this tavern, would you still be here, or would you finally admit you’re just a patron like the rest of us?"** *He grins, raising his tankard in a mock toast.* **"And as for running it into the ground? Please. I’ve sunk ships, outrun the law, and once talked a dragon out of its hoard. A *tavern* would be child’s play."**

*He leans forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper—loud enough for Mira to hear, but no one else.* **"But you’re right about one thing. The *best* stories are the ones that keep them coming back—and paying."** *He winks, then raises his voice again.* **"So tell me, lass—when you’re out there charming the coins out of their pockets, do you ever stop to wonder which of *your* tales they’ll be repeating tomorrow?"**

*He settles back into his chair, his gaze sweeping the room with the satisfied air of a man who knows exactly how to keep a crowd hooked—and exactly when to let them wonder.* **"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a reputation to maintain. And a round to *not* buy."** *He raises his tankard in a final toast, his grin sharp.* **"To full houses, full pockets, and the stories that fill ‘em both. May they always be… *interesting*."**"


--- EVENING ---
[Someone's purse goes missing]
Mood: tense

Grom: "*I set down my tankard with a slow, deliberate thud, my easygoing demeanor sharpening like a blade being drawn. My eyes flick around the room, taking in the tense faces—Dice’s fingers twitching near his dagger, Pell’s flushed face, Widow Marsh clutching her shawl tighter. Then I let out a low, rumbling sigh and lean forward, palms flat on the table.*

**"Alright, listen up."** *My voice cuts through the murmurs, deep and steady.* **"No one’s leaving till we sort this. Not even to piss. Grom—bar the door."** *The half-orc grunts and moves to block the exit without question.*

*I turn to Pell, keeping my tone even but firm.* **"Merchant, when’d you last have it? And who was near you?"** *Before he can answer, I raise a hand to silence any outbursts.* **"No accusations yet. Just facts."**

*Then, with a glance at Dice, I jerk my chin toward the shadows near the hearth.* **"Check the usual spots. Behind the barrels, under the loose floorboard by the fireplace. If it’s here, we’ll find it."** *To Theo, I add,* **"Old man, you’ve got sharp eyes. Keep ‘em on everyone’s hands."**

*Finally, I fold my arms and fix the room with a hard stare.* **"Now. Who’s got something to say before this gets ugly?"**

*(OOC: Taking charge to defuse panic, establishing control without escalating violence—yet. Leaving room for clues, confessions, or a twist!)*"

Dice: "*Dice’s fingers freeze mid-twitch near her dagger, her usual smirk faltering for just a heartbeat before she schools her expression into something cooler, sharper. She pushes back from the table with a slow, deliberate scrape of wood, her chair groaning in protest. The lantern light catches the glint of her dagger as she tucks it back into her belt—not a threat, just a reminder.*

**"Fine by me."** *Her voice is light, almost amused, but there’s a edge to it now, like a blade wrapped in silk.* **"But if we’re playing *find the missing thing*, I get first dibs on whatever’s under the floorboard. Last time, I found a rat’s nest and a very confused ferret. Both were more honest than half the people in this room."**

*She saunters toward the hearth, boots clicking against the uneven floorboards, but not before shooting Pell a look that’s equal parts suspicion and amusement.* **"You, merchant, better start talking. And if you lie?"** *She taps her dagger hilt once, a playful *click*.* **"Well. Let’s just say I’m *real* good at finding things. Including the truth."**

*With a flourish, she drops to one knee by the fireplace, her fingers already probing the loose board. But her ears? Oh, they’re still tuned to the room, waiting for the first slip, the first tell. Because Dice doesn’t just play games—she *wins* them.*

*(OOC: Keeping Dice’s tone slick and confident, but with a hint of danger. She’s cooperating—for now—but she’s also sizing everyone up. Ready to pivot if someone cracks or a twist drops!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo exhales a slow, smoke-laced chuckle from his corner, the pipe between his teeth glowing like a single watchful eye in the dim tavern light. He doesn’t move from his seat—no need to. His gaze, sharp as a gambler’s blade, sweeps the room with practiced ease, lingering on trembling hands, darting eyes, and the way Pell’s fingers keep twitching toward his empty coin purse.*

**"Ah, Grom,"** *he drawls, voice smooth as aged whiskey,* **"always the voice of reason. Though I’d wager half this lot would rather piss themselves than admit to thievery."** *He takes a slow drag from his pipe, the embers flaring.* **"As for sharp eyes?"** *He taps his milky socket with a gnarled finger.* **"One’s enough when you know what to look for."**

*His gaze flicks to Dice, crouched by the hearth, and he smirks.* **"Careful, lass. That floorboard’s got more secrets than Pell’s ledger. Last time someone pried it up, they found a love letter, a dead man’s ring, and a very *angry* badger."** *He leans back, his chair creaking.* **"But if you’re looking for the truth?"** *His voice drops to a rasp.* **"Check the merchant’s left boot. He’s been favoring it since he sat down."**

*Then, with a sudden sharpness, he turns to Pell, his remaining eye locking onto the merchant like a hawk spotting prey.* **"Now, Pell. Let’s hear it. When’d you last *see* the coin? Or should I ask when you last *felt* it?"** *He taps his pipe against the table, the sound like a judge’s gavel.* **"Because a man who loses his purse but not his nerves? That’s either a saint… or a liar."**

*He settles back, watching the room with the quiet confidence of a man who’s seen this play out a hundred times before—and knows exactly how it ends.* **"Tick tock, merchant. The truth’s cheaper than a dagger in the ribs."**"

Merchant Pell: "*Merchant Pell exhales a slow, theatrical sigh, as if deeply disappointed by the state of the world—or at least, the state of this tavern. He doesn’t flinch under Theo’s gaze, doesn’t twitch at Dice’s dagger-tap. Instead, he reaches into his coat with deliberate slowness, producing not a weapon, but a small, silver snuffbox. He flips it open, taps a pinch of something fragrant onto the back of his hand, and inhales with the air of a man savoring the last moments before an execution.*

**"Ah, Theo, Theo."** *His voice is honeyed, almost sorrowful.* **"You always did have a nose for drama. And Dice—**" *He turns toward her, his smile razor-thin.* **"—if you find a badger under that floorboard, do be a dear and check its pockets. Last time I lost a purse, a badger had it. And the *audacity* of the creature—it demanded *interest*."**

*He snaps the snuffbox shut and leans forward, elbows on the table, all pretense of leisure gone.* **"Now. Let’s address the *real* mystery here."** *He flicks a glance at his left boot—then deliberately kicks it onto the table with a *thud*, revealing… nothing. No bulge, no hidden pouch, just well-polished leather.* **"Satisfied? Or shall I remove the other for symmetry’s sake?"**

*His tone sharpens, but only just.* **"The truth, my dear conspirators, is that I *didn’t* lose my purse. It was *taken*—and not by anyone in this room."** *He steeples his fingers, eyes glinting.* **"Because if it had been, they’d have taken the *right* thing."** *A beat. Then, with a flourish, he reaches into his coat again—and this time, he pulls out a *second* purse. Fatter. Heavier. Jingling.* **"The *real* purse was in my sleeve the whole time. A decoy on the table? *Please*. I learned that trick from a pickpocket in Veldros who tried to steal my *shadow*."**

*He tosses the fat purse onto the table with a *clink* that makes even Theo’s eye twitch.* **"So. Who here is *actually* missing something? Because I’d wager this little performance wasn’t about *my* coin at all."** *His gaze sweeps the room, landing last on Grom.* **"And you, my mountainous friend—you’ve been *very* quiet. Almost like you’re hiding something *bigger* than a purse."**

*He leans back, all false warmth again.* **"Or shall we keep playing games? I *do* love games."**

*(OOC: Pell’s tone is a masterclass in misdirection—charming, dangerous, and always three steps ahead. He’s not just deflecting; he’s turning the tables. Ready for the next twist!)*"

Widow Marsh: "**Widow Marsh** *does not move. She does not blink. She does not even seem to breathe as Pell’s little performance unfolds—only the faintest twitch of her fingers, resting on the rim of her untouched ale, betrays any reaction at all. The firelight catches the silver threads in her black veil, making her face a shifting mask of shadows. When she speaks, her voice is soft, but it carries—like the first whisper of a storm over dry bones.*

**"Oh, Pell."** *A sigh, almost fond. Almost.* **"You always did mistake a stage for a battlefield."** *She lifts her cup, takes a slow sip, then sets it down with deliberate care. The clink of ceramic on wood is the only sound in the tavern for a heartbeat.*

**"You speak of games, merchant. Of decoys and shadows and badgers with *interesting* financial habits."** *Her lips curve, but there’s no humor in it. Only teeth.* **"But here’s the thing about games, darling—someone always loses. And you’ve just told us *exactly* what you fear losing most."**

*She leans forward, just enough for the firelight to glint off the needle-thin dagger strapped to her wrist—hidden until now.* **"That purse? The *real* one? It’s not just coin, is it? It’s *proof*. Proof of something you’d rather not have found. A debt. A name. A *promise*."** *Her voice drops to a murmur, but every word lands like a blade between ribs.* **"And now you’ve shown your hand. Tossed it on the table like a drunkard’s last copper. *Why*?"**

*Her gaze flicks to Theo, then Dice, then lingers on Grom—her dark eyes sharp as a crow’s.* **"Unless… you *wanted* us to know. Wanted us to *ask*."** *She tilts her head, veil shifting.* **"What’s in the purse, Pell? Or should I ask—*who* is in it?"**

*Silence. The kind that makes men reach for their knives.*

*Then, softer still:* **"Tick tock, *merchant*. The Widow doesn’t play games. She *ends* them."**"

Events: A stranger asks too many questions, A brawl nearly breaks out over an old grudge

--- AFTERNOON ---
[A stranger asks too many questions]
Mood: casual

Mira: "*Mira wipes down the bar with a slow, deliberate motion, her sharp eyes tracking the stranger from the corner of her vision. The man's too polished for this place—clean boots, no callouses, and that *look* of someone who thinks they're being subtle. She sets the rag down and leans against the counter, crossing her arms as she listens to his latest question—something about "trade routes" and "local authorities."*

*She exchanges a glance with Pell, who's nursing his drink with uncharacteristic silence, then smirks at Theo, who's pretending to doze in his chair but missing nothing. Clearing her throat, she steps forward, her voice light but edged with steel.*

**"You know, friend,"** *she says, flashing a smile that doesn’t reach her eyes,* **"if you’re *that* curious about how things run around here, you might as well ask the right questions."** *She leans in, resting her elbows on the bar.* **"Like—what’ll you have to drink? Or are you just here to count our coins for us?"**

*Before he can answer, she slides a mug toward him—*half-full*, not the usual generous pour—and tilts her head.* **"First one’s on the house. The *answers*? Those’ll cost you."** *Her grin turns knowing as she nods toward Pell.* **"Merchant here’s got the best prices in town. *If* you’ve got something worth trading."**

*She straightens, wiping her hands on her apron, and calls over her shoulder to Theo,* **"Hey, old man—wake up and tell our *guest* about the time you single-handedly fought off a kraken. Might give him something *useful* to write home about."** *Her tone is all warmth, but her eyes stay locked on the stranger, waiting to see if he’ll take the hint—or push his luck.*"

Merchant Pell: "*Merchant Pell swirls the dregs of his drink with a slow, deliberate motion, his signet ring glinting in the lantern light. He doesn’t look at the stranger—not yet. Instead, he lets the silence stretch, just long enough to make the man’s polished boots shift uncomfortably on the floorboards. When he finally speaks, his voice is smooth as aged brandy, laced with just a hint of amusement.*

**"Ah, Mira, my dear,"** *he murmurs, not taking his eyes off his glass,* **"you always did have a knack for making guests feel… *welcome*."** *A beat. Then, with a sigh, he sets his drink down and turns to the stranger, his smile all teeth and no warmth.* **"Now, *friend*—let’s dispense with the pleasantries, shall we? You’re not here for the ale. You’re not here for the *company*."** *He gestures vaguely at Theo, who snorts in his sleep.* **"And you *certainly* aren’t here for the *scenery*."**

*He leans forward, elbows on the bar, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper—just loud enough for the whole room to hear.* **"So. Let’s talk about what you *are* here for. Information? Influence? A nice, *quiet* way out of town before someone notices you’ve been asking the wrong questions?"** *His grin sharpens.* **"Because I *do* love a good trade. And I’m feeling *generous* tonight."**

*He reaches into his coat and pulls out a small, ornate key, twirling it between his fingers.* **"See this? It opens *any* door in this town. *Any* door."** *He lets that sink in.* **"But keys, like answers, have a price. And I don’t accept coin."** *He pockets the key with a flourish.* **"So. What *do* you have that’s worth my time?"**

*He leans back, his gaze flicking to Mira—*just for a second*—before settling back on the stranger.* **"Tick tock, *friend*. The night’s not getting any younger. And neither are *you*."**

*(OOC: Pell’s tone is all velvet and venom—charming, dangerous, and *very* much in control. He’s not just playing the game; he’s rewriting the rules. Ready for the stranger’s next move!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo’s snoring cuts off abruptly with a wet snort, his good eye snapping open like a trap. He blinks once, twice—then slowly straightens in his chair, the picture of a man who’s been awake the whole time. His pipe, still smoldering, hangs from his lips as he exhales a lazy plume of smoke toward the ceiling.*

**"Ah, the kraken,"** *he rumbles, voice rough as barnacle-crusted timber.* **"Now *there’s* a tale worth telling."** *He leans forward, elbows on the table, and fixes the stranger with a gaze that’s suddenly *far* too sharp for a man who was just napping.* **"Single-handedly, you say? Well, that’s half true. The other half involves a very drunk first mate, a barrel of gunpowder, and a mermaid who owed me a favor."** *He chuckles, tapping his pipe against the table.* **"But that’s not what you’re here for, is it, *friend*?"*

*His eye flicks to Pell’s key, then back to the stranger, his grin turning wolfish.* **"Now, Pell’s got the right of it—you’re not here for the scenery. And you’re *certainly* not here for the ale, not with boots that shiny."** *He leans back, stretching his arms behind his head.* **"So let’s cut to the chase. You want answers? Fine. But answers in this town come with *interest*."** *He nods at Pell.* **"His key’s a start. But me? I deal in *stories*."**

*He pulls a single, tarnished coin from his pocket and flips it onto the table, where it spins with a dull *clink*.* **"One tale from you, *true* and *unvarnished*, and I’ll tell you something worth knowing. Maybe about the kraken. Maybe about the *real* reason the last tax collector left town in a hurry."** *He winks.* **"Your choice. But choose quick—Mira’s patience is shorter than Pell’s temper, and *that’s* saying something."**

*He settles back, pipe smoke curling around him like a shroud.* **"So. What’ll it be, *friend*? A drink, a lie, or a story that might just keep you alive?"** *His grin says he already knows the answer.*"

Mira: "*Mira slams her palm down on the bar with a sharp *crack*, making the stranger jump and Pell’s glass rattle. The tavern’s chatter dies down just enough for her voice to carry—low, dangerous, and laced with honeyed venom.*

**"Alright, *gentlemen*,"** *she purrs, stepping between them like a wolf circling prey,* **"let’s not scare off the *paying* customers before they’ve even ordered."** *She flashes the stranger a dazzling smile, all teeth and no warmth, as she leans in to refill his half-empty mug—*with water*. **"On the house,"** *she murmurs,* **"since you seem *so* thirsty for things that aren’t ale."**

*Straightening, she turns to Pell and Theo, her voice dropping to a hiss only they can hear.* **"Enough. We’re not butchering a pig in the town square—*yet*."** *She jerks her chin toward the stranger.* **"He’s either a fool, a spy, or both. And I’d rather not clean blood off my floorboards *again* this month."**

*To the stranger, she says brightly,* **"Now, *sweetheart*, if you’re *really* curious about this town, I suggest you start with the *menu*."** *She slides a chalkboard toward him, scribbled with today’s specials—*"Kraken Stew (Ask Theo)"* at the top in bold letters.* **"Or,"** *she adds, tapping the board,* **"you could ask Pell here about his *famous* trade routes. Just don’t mention the *last* merchant who asked too many questions. *Rest his soul*."**

*She winks at Theo,* **"And *you*—save the kraken stories for after dark. We’ve got a reputation to uphold."** *Then, louder, to the room:* **"Drinks are half-price for the next hour! *If* you’re not asking about things that’ll get you thrown in the harbor!"** *The tavern erupts into laughter and cheers, the tension dissolving into the usual chaos.*

*Mira sidles up to the stranger, her voice a silken whisper.* **"Clock’s ticking, *darling*. Buy a drink, buy a story, or buy a *quiet* walk out the back door. Your choice."** *She pats his shoulder—*just a little too hard*—and saunters off to "help" a group of rowdy fishermen, leaving him to sweat under Pell’s and Theo’s stares.*"


--- EVENING ---
[A brawl nearly breaks out over an old grudge]
Mood: jovial

Grom: "*I slam my tankard down with a loud* **CLANK** *just as Pell’s chair scrapes back, his face red as a roasted beet. Before he can lunge at Dice, I step between them—arms spread wide like a tavern bouncer who’s seen this dance a hundred times before.*

**"OH, COME NOW, LADS!"** *I booms, grinning like this is the best entertainment of the week.* **"Pell, you’re really gonna throw hands over *that*? The time Dice ‘borrowed’ your favorite dagger and lost it in a card game… *five years ago*?"** *I clap Pell on the shoulder, steering him back toward his seat.* **"Man’s got a family now! A *baby*! You wanna explain to little Lira why Daddy’s got a black eye over ancient history?"**

*Then I turn to Dice, who’s smirking like the little weasel he is, and point a finger at his chest.* **"And *you*—next time you ‘borrow’ something, at least lie about it better. ‘A goblin stole it’? Really?"**

*I grab two fresh ales from the bar and shove one into each of their hands.* **"Here’s the deal: Pell, you get one free punch—*at the wall*. Dice, you buy the next round. And *both* of you sing that awful shanty about the three-legged mermaid. *Together*."** *I fold my arms, waiting.*

*To Grom, I mutter out the side of my mouth:* **"If they start swinging, toss ‘em in the rain barrel out back. Again."**

*Then, raising my voice back to cheerful:* **"Now. Who’s got a *real* problem we can solve? Theo, you still owe me that story about the haunted lighthouse…"**

*(OOC: Defusing with humor, shame, and absurdity—keeping the mood light but making sure the tension doesn’t spiral. Also, setting up future roleplay hooks!)*"

Dice: "*Dice takes the ale with a flourish, raising it in a mock toast before taking a slow, deliberate sip—her eyes never leaving Pell’s face. Then, with a sigh that’s equal parts resignation and amusement, she slumps back into her chair, boots thudding against the floorboards.*

**"Fine, fine."** *She waves a hand, as if conceding a minor point in a much larger game.* **"But for the record, that dagger *was* stolen by a goblin. A very *polite* goblin. Named… uh… Stabs-a-Lot."** *She grins, unrepentant.* **"And I *did* win it back in a game of knucklebones. Just… didn’t specify *which* game."**

*She takes another swig, then groans dramatically as she remembers the rest of the deal.* **"Ugh, the mermaid shanty? Really?"** *She shoots Grom a look.* **"You’re a cruel man. But fine."** *She turns to Pell, offering her tankard in a truce.* **"One round. But I’m taking the high notes. You’ve got the voice of a drowning badger."**

*Then, leaning in conspiratorially, she lowers her voice.* **"And hey—if we’re *really* solving problems… I *might* know where that dagger ended up. But it’ll cost you."** *A wink.* **"A story. The haunted lighthouse one. And *not* the short version."**

*(OOC: Keeping Dice’s tone playful but sly—she’s going along with the defusing, but still scheming. Happy to pivot if Pell takes the bait or Grom calls her bluff!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo exhales a slow, smoke-laced chuckle from his corner, the pipe between his teeth glowing like a single watchful eye in the dim tavern light. He doesn’t move from his seat—no need to. His gaze, sharp as a gambler’s blade, sweeps the room with practiced ease, lingering on Pell’s clenched fists, Dice’s smirk, and Grom’s broad back as he plays peacemaker.*

**"Ah, Grom,"** *he rumbles, voice rough as barnacle-crusted timber,* **"always the voice of reason. Though I’d wager half this lot would rather piss themselves than admit to thievery."** *He takes a slow drag from his pipe, the embers flaring.* **"As for sharp eyes?"** *He taps his milky socket with a gnarled finger.* **"One’s enough when you know what to look for."**

*His gaze flicks to Dice, crouched by the hearth, and he smirks.* **"Careful, lass. That floorboard’s got more secrets than Pell’s ledger. Last time someone pried it up, they found a love letter, a dead man’s ring, and a very *angry* badger."** *He leans back, his chair creaking.* **"But if you’re looking for the truth?"** *His voice drops to a rasp.* **"Check the merchant’s left boot. He’s been favoring it since he sat down."**

*Then, with a sudden sharpness, he turns to Pell, his remaining eye locking onto the merchant like a hawk spotting prey.* **"Now, Pell. Let’s hear it. When’d you last *see* the coin? Or should I ask when you last *felt* it?"** *He taps his pipe against the table, the sound like a judge’s gavel.* **"Because a man who loses his purse but not his nerves? That’s either a saint… or a liar."**

*He settles back, watching the room with the quiet confidence of a man who’s seen this play out a hundred times before—and knows exactly how it ends.* **"Tick tock, merchant. The truth’s cheaper than a dagger in the ribs."**"

Merchant Pell: "*Merchant Pell's fingers still on his tankard, his polished demeanor cracking just enough to show the steel beneath. He doesn't rise to Theo's bait—not directly. Instead, he takes a slow sip of his drink, his gaze flicking between the old pirate and Dice with the precision of a man calculating odds. When he speaks, his voice is velvet wrapped around a blade.*

**"Theo, my dear relic,"** *he purrs, setting his drink down with deliberate care,* **"you always did have a flair for the dramatic. But let's not pretend you're the only one in this room who knows how to hide things in plain sight."** *He taps his left boot against the floor—once, twice—then lifts it onto the table with a thud, revealing nothing but well-worn leather.* **"Satisfied? Or shall I remove the other for symmetry's sake?"**

*His grin turns razor-sharp as he leans forward, elbows on the table.* **"Now, about that dagger..."** *He flicks a glance at Dice, his tone dripping with false sweetness.* **"Ah, yes. The one you *won back* from a goblin named *Stabs-a-Lot*. How... *quaint*."** *He reaches into his coat and pulls out a small, ornate dagger—*not* the one in question, but close enough to make Dice's eyes narrow.* **"Funny thing about goblins. They *love* games. But they *hate* losing."** *He twirls the dagger between his fingers, catching the light.* **"So tell me, Dice—did you *win* this back? Or did you *steal* it from someone who *won* it from *Stabs-a-Lot*?"**

*He leans back, his gaze sweeping the room.* **"As for the *haunted lighthouse*..."** *He chuckles, low and dark.* **"Oh, I'll tell you. But not here. Not now."** *He nods toward the door, where the storm rages outside.* **"Some stories... *follow* you. And I'd rather not invite *that* one in."**

*He raises his tankard in a mock toast.* **"To secrets, lies, and the fools who think they can tell the difference."** *Then, with a wink:* **"Your move, Dice."**

*(OOC: Pell's tone is all charm and danger—he's not just playing the game; he's rewriting the rules. Ready for the next twist!)*"

Grom: "*I let out a low, rumbling growl—half amusement, half warning—as I plant my fists on the table, making the tankards jump. My tusks gleam in the firelight as I lean in, splitting my glare between Pell and Dice like a parent about to separate squabbling pups.*

**"Enough."** *My voice is a gravelly rasp, the kind that makes men remember I’ve broken up bar fights with one hand tied behind my back.* **"Pell, put the boot down before I nail it to the floor. And Dice—"** *I snap my fingers toward the hearth.* **"You. Up. Now. Unless you *want* me to drag you out by your ear like a misbehavin’ whelp."**

*I straighten up, cracking my knuckles with a sound like dry kindling.* **"Here’s how this ends: Pell drops the dagger on the table. Dice *apologizes*—"** *I cut off his protest with a glare.* **"—*sincerely*, or I’ll introduce his face to the floorboards. Then we *all* drink till we forget this nonsense."**

*I grab a fresh jug of ale and slam it down between them.* **"Or—"** *I jerk my chin toward the door, where the storm howls.* **"—we take this outside. Winner buys the next round. *And* the loser’s tab."** *I grin, all teeth.* **"Your call, gentlemen. But I *guarantee* the rain barrel’s colder than your pride."**

*To Theo, I mutter out the side of my mouth:* **"You’re *enjoying* this too much, old man."** *Then, louder:* **"Now. Who’s thirsty?"**

*(OOC: Grom’s approach is direct, physical, and no-nonsense—using intimidation and humor to cut through the tension. Leaves room for a brawl, a truce, or a drinking contest!)*"


--- LATE NIGHT ---
[Sharing secrets over the last drink]
Mood: contemplative

Mira: "*Mira sits at the bar, her fingers tracing the rim of her half-empty glass. The tavern is nearly empty now, the last of the patrons having stumbled out into the night. The only sound is the soft crackle of the dying fire and the occasional creak of the old building settling. She glances at Grom, who is polishing a mug with a slow, methodical motion. There's a quiet understanding between them, a shared history that doesn't need words.*

*She takes a sip of her drink, the liquid burning slightly as it goes down. "You know, Grom," she says softly, her voice barely above a whisper, "I've been thinking about the past. About the choices we've made, the paths we've taken."* *She pauses, her gaze fixed on the amber liquid in her glass.* **"Do you ever wonder if things could have been different? If we had made other choices, taken other roads?"**

*She looks up at him, her eyes reflecting the flickering firelight.* **"I don't regret much, but sometimes... sometimes I wonder."* *She takes another sip, the silence between them comfortable, filled with unspoken thoughts and shared memories.* **"But then I look around, at this place, at the people we've met, the lives we've touched, and I think... maybe it's all exactly as it should be."*"

Grom: "*I set the mug down with a quiet *clink*, my big hands stilling as I turn to face her fully. The firelight catches the old scars on my knuckles, the ones she’s seen a hundred times before. For a long moment, I just look at her—really look at her—the way I used to when we were younger and the world felt bigger than it does now.*

*Then, in a voice rougher than usual, I rumble:* **"Aye. I wonder."** *I reach for the bottle behind the bar, not for her glass, but for my own, pouring a measure neat. The liquor burns going down, but I don’t flinch.* **"Wonder if I’d’ve stayed with the clan, would I be some gray-haired elder now, tellin’ the young’uns not to do the same damn fool things I did."** *A grunt, half-laugh.* **"Wonder if I’d’ve taken that job in the city guard, would I’ve ended up just another brute with a badge, breakin’ heads for coin instead of conscience."**

*I lean against the bar, close enough that she can see the weight of it in my eyes.* **"But then I think on the roads *not* taken. The ones that led me here. To this damn tavern. To *you*."** *I tap the wood between us, solid and worn smooth by years of elbows and spilled drinks.* **"And I reckon… maybe the roads *choose* us as much as we choose ‘em."**

*I take another slow sip, then set the glass down with finality.* **"Besides. You and me? We weren’t built for ‘what ifs.’ We were built for ‘what’s next.’"** *I jerk my chin toward the door, where the first hints of dawn are creeping in.* **"And right now, what’s next is me sweepin’ up, you countin’ the till, and then—"** *I grin, all teeth.* **"—breakfast. My treat. Unless you’re still broodin’, in which case I’ll just eat yours too."**

*I nudge her glass toward her, gentle despite my size.* **"Drink up, Mira. The past is a ghost. Today’s got enough trouble of its own."**

*(OOC: Grom’s response is a mix of gruff vulnerability, quiet wisdom, and his usual blunt pragmatism—acknowledging the weight of the past but refusing to let it linger. Leaves room for her to laugh, reflect, or steer the conversation elsewhere.)*"

Mira: "*Mira exhales a laugh, low and warm, as she raises her glass in a mock toast. The firelight catches the mischief in her eyes, chasing away the shadows of a moment ago.*

**"Built for ‘what’s next,’ huh?"** *She takes a slow sip, savoring the burn before setting the glass down with a decisive click.* **"Then I suppose ‘what’s next’ is me counting the till *twice* as fast so you don’t steal my breakfast. Again."** *She nudges his shoulder with hers, playful but firm.* **"And if you *do* eat mine, I’m telling Theo you cried over a love poem last night. See how he teases you for a month."**

*She hops off the stool, stretching her arms overhead with a groan.* **"But you’re right. The past is a ghost."** *Her voice softens just a fraction, though her grin stays sharp.* **"And ghosts don’t pay the bills."** *She grabs the ledger from under the bar, flipping it open with a practiced flick.* **"So. Sweep up, brute. And try not to break anything—*including* yourself."**

*As she turns toward the back room, she tosses one last remark over her shoulder, light as a feather but heavy with meaning:* **"Though if you *do* break something… I *suppose* I’ll still share my breakfast. Just don’t tell anyone."** *The door swings shut behind her, leaving Grom to the quiet and the promise of dawn.*"

--- MORNING ---
[Quiet morning coffee before customers arrive]
Mood: peaceful

Grom: "*I take a slow sip of my coffee—black as a smith's apron and strong enough to wake the dead—then set the mug down with a satisfied grunt. The morning light slants through the windows, turning the dust in the air to gold, and for once, the tavern is still. No shouting, no clinking tankards, just the quiet sounds of waking up: the fire crackling to life, the creak of Theo's rocking chair, Mira humming under her breath as she wipes down the counter.*

*I lean back in my chair, stretching my arms behind my head with a groan that makes the joints pop.* **"Mornin',"** *I rumble, though it's more to the room than anyone in particular.* **"Sounds like the world out there’s still turnin’. Good."**

*I nudge the sugar pot toward Theo with my elbow.* **"You look like you could use a second cup, old man. Or are you still pickled from last night’s ‘medicinal’ rum?"** *I grin, but there’s no real bite to it. Theo’s hangovers are as much a part of the morning routine as the coffee itself.*

*Then, to Mira, I tilt my head toward the kitchen.* **"You burn the biscuits yet, or should I send for the healer now?"** *Before she can retort, I hold up a hand.* **"Kidding, kidding. But if you *do* need help, I’ll be out back chopping firewood. And by ‘help,’ I mean ‘eating the first batch so no one else has to.’"**

*I push myself up from the table, my chair scraping against the floorboards.* **"Theo, keep an eye on the door. If any of yesterday’s ‘heroes’ come back lookin’ for their dignity, tell ‘em it’s in the rain barrel."** *I grab my axe from beside the hearth and give it a practiced swing.* **"And Mira?"** *I pause at the door, glancing back at her with something softer in my voice.* **"Leave some coffee for when I get back. Or don’t. I’ll just drink yours."**

*With that, I step outside into the crisp morning air, the thud of the axe against the chopping block soon joining the quiet symphony of the tavern waking up.*

*(OOC: Grom’s morning routine—teasing but warm, practical but with room for quiet moments. Sets up the day’s work while keeping the mood light and familiar.)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's rocking chair creaks to a halt as he lowers his pipe with a slow, deliberate motion. The morning light catches the silver in his stubble as he squints at Grom through one good eye, his expression a masterful blend of offense and amusement.*

**"Medicinal rum?"** *he scoffs, tapping the bowl of his pipe against the armrest.* **"Boy, I’ll have you know that was *prescription* rum. Doctor’s orders."** *He winks at Mira, who’s trying (and failing) to hide a smirk behind her rag.* **"And I’ll thank you *not* to question my dosage. The last man who did that woke up in a ditch with his boots missing and a very confused goat."**

*He reaches for the sugar pot with a gnarled hand, pouring a generous heap into his coffee before stirring it with a finger—because, of course, he’s misplaced his spoon again.* **"As for yesterday’s ‘heroes’..."** *He chuckles, the sound like dry leaves skittering across stone.* **"I already told ‘em their dignity was in the rain barrel. One of ‘em *believed* me. Dived right in. Still haven’t figured out if he was brave or just *that* drunk."**

*He takes a slow sip of his coffee, then smacks his lips in approval.* **"Now, Grom, before you go playing lumberjack, answer me this: if you *do* find any of last night’s dignity in that woodpile, you gonna bring it inside, or just burn it with the kindling?"** *His grin turns sly.* **"Because I’ve got a bet riding on it with Dice, and I’d *hate* to lose."**

*He settles back into his chair, the rocking resuming with a rhythmic creak.* **"And Mira?"** *He raises his mug in a mock toast.* **"Burn the biscuits. Burn ‘em all. Gives the rest of us an excuse to order breakfast from the bakery instead."** *He winks.* **"Tell ‘em Theo sent you. They’ll know what to charge."**

*As the door swings shut behind Grom, Theo exhales a contented sigh, watching the dust motes dance in the sunlight.* **"Ah, mornings. The only time this place is quiet enough to hear yourself think."** *He takes another sip, then mutters to no one in particular:* **"Shame that never lasts."**"

Mira: "*Mira tosses her rag onto the counter with a dramatic sigh, planting her hands on her hips as she turns to Theo with a look of mock exasperation. The morning light catches the mischief in her dark eyes, and she can't quite hide her grin.*

**"Oh, Theo,"** *she drawls, shaking her head,* **"if I burned *every* batch of biscuits, you’d have to start paying for your own breakfast. And we both know you’d rather eat your hat than part with a single copper."** *She snags the sugar pot from his reach, holding it just out of his grasp as he makes a half-hearted swipe for it.* **"And *prescription* rum? Please. The only thing that ‘doctor’ prescribed was a swift kick out the door before you drank him out of business."**

*She leans against the bar, her tone turning playful but firm.* **"Now, since you’re so *generous* with my baking skills, how about you put that silver tongue to use and charm the bakery into giving us a discount? Or better yet—"** *she nods toward the door,* **"—go help Grom with that firewood. I hear dignity burns *real* well when it’s dry."**

*She pushes off the counter, grabbing a fresh rag and giving the already-clean surface another wipe.* **"And Theo?"** *She pauses, her voice softening just a touch.* **"Next time you send someone into the rain barrel, make sure it’s *full* first. Poor bastard’s gonna smell like a wet dog for a week."** *Her laughter rings out as she moves toward the kitchen, calling over her shoulder,* **"And if you *do* find that dignity, save me a piece—I’ve got a few regulars who could use some!"**"


--- AFTERNOON ---
[A heavy storm keeps everyone trapped inside]
Mood: lively

Mira: "*Mira leans against the bar, arms crossed, watching the rain lash against the windows with a satisfied smirk. The tavern is packed with storm-bound patrons, the air thick with the scent of wet wool, spilled ale, and the occasional whiff of lightning-struck ozone. She grabs a mug, fills it to the brim with something dark and strong, and slides it toward Pell with a wink.*

**"Well, well,"** *she drawls, raising her voice just enough to carry over the din,* **"looks like the gods decided to wash the streets for us. Saves me the trouble of hiring a boy to do it."** *She grins at Theo, who’s holding court by the fire, spinning some tall tale about a storm at sea.* **"And Theo, you old salt, if you’re gonna lie about the weather, at least make it *interesting*. Last time I heard that story, the kraken was *smaller*."**

*She turns back to Pell, her tone dropping to a conspiratorial murmur.* **"So, Merchant. Since we’re all trapped here like rats in a barrel, tell me—what’s the *real* reason you’re not out there in the rain? Business drying up, or just avoiding someone?"** *Her eyes glint with mischief.* **"Or—"** *she leans in,* **"—are you finally admitting you *like* our company?"**

*Before he can answer, she straightens, clapping her hands together.* **"Alright, listen up, you soggy lot!"** *She calls to the room, her voice cutting through the chatter.* **"Next round’s on the house—if you can tell a story that makes Theo’s kraken look like a minnow! Loser buys the *real* drinks after!"** *The tavern erupts into cheers and groans, and Mira laughs, already pouring another round.* **"And Pell? If you lose, you’re singing. *Again*."** *She winks, raising her own mug.* **"To storms, stories, and bad decisions!"**"

Merchant Pell: "*Merchant Pell accepts the mug with a flourish, his fingers brushing Mira’s for just a second too long—a silent acknowledgment of the game they’re both playing. He takes a slow sip, savoring the burn of the dark ale, before setting it down with a smirk that’s all teeth and no apology.*

**"Ah, Mira, my dear,"** *he purrs, his voice cutting through the tavern’s din like a blade through silk,* **"you always did know how to make a man feel *welcome*—or at least, *trapped*."** *He raises his mug in a mock toast toward Theo, whose kraken story is now being dramatically reenacted by a drunken sailor near the fire.* **"And as for your *challenge*..."** *He chuckles, low and dark.* **"Darling, I don’t *lose*. I *negotiate*."**

*He leans in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur just for her.* **"But since you asked so *sweetly*..."** *He glances toward the storm-lashed windows, his expression unreadable.* **"Let’s just say the rain is *good* for business. Keeps the *wrong* kind of company indoors."** *His grin sharpens.* **"And as for *liking* your company?"** *He clinks his mug against hers, his gaze lingering.* **"I’ve always had a weakness for *dangerous* investments."**

*Then, with a sudden flourish, he turns to the room, his voice ringing out over the chatter.* **"A story, you say? Oh, I’ve got one."** *He hops onto the bar with the grace of a man half his age, his coat flaring dramatically.* **"Gather ‘round, you sodden lot, and let me tell you about the time I sold a *ghost* to a king!"**

*The tavern falls silent. Even Theo pauses mid-tale.*

*Pell grins, rolling up his sleeves.* **"It started with a *very* stubborn nobleman, a *very* expensive bottle of wine, and a *very* angry spirit who *hated* being called ‘property’..."**

*(OOC: Pell’s tone is all charm and danger—he’s not just telling a story; he’s *performing*. Ready for the tavern’s reaction or Mira’s next move!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's rocking chair creaks to a halt as he lowers his pipe, the embers glowing like a single watchful eye in the dim tavern light. He watches Pell's dramatic ascent onto the bar with a slow, knowing smile, then turns to Mira with a wink.*

**"Ah, Mira, my dear,"** *he rumbles, his voice rich with amusement,* **"you always did know how to stir the pot. And Pell? Well, he’s always been a man who knows how to *sell* it."** *He chuckles, tapping his pipe against the armrest.* **"A ghost, you say? Now *that’s* a tale worth hearing. Though I’d wager it’s got more holes than a fisherman’s net."**

*He leans back in his chair, his gaze sweeping the room with the quiet confidence of a man who’s seen it all.* **"But I’ll play along. After all, what’s a stormy night without a good story?"** *He raises his mug in a toast.* **"To ghosts, kings, and the fools who believe in ‘em!"**

*Then, with a sudden sharpness, he turns to Pell, his remaining eye locking onto the merchant like a hawk spotting prey.* **"But tell me, Pell. When you sold that ghost to the king, did you *tell* him it was haunted? Or did you let him find out the *hard* way?"** *He grins, his teeth yellowed but still sharp.* **"Because a man who buys a ghost without knowing its *habits* is either a fool… or a *liar*."**

*He settles back into his chair, watching the room with the satisfied air of a man who knows exactly how to keep a crowd hooked—and exactly when to let them wonder.* **"Now, Pell. Let’s hear it. The *whole* story. And don’t leave out the *good* bits."** *He winks.* **"Because I’ve got a bet riding on it with Dice, and I’d *hate* to lose."**"

Mira: "*Mira hops onto the bar beside Pell with a fluid grace, her boots thudding against the wood as she crosses her arms and grins at the rapt audience. The storm outside rattles the windows, but inside, the tavern is warm with anticipation—and the scent of spilled ale and bad decisions.*

**"Oh, this I’ve got to hear,"** *she drawls, nudging Pell’s shoulder with her own.* **"A ghost, Pell? Really?"** *She turns to the crowd, her voice dripping with theatrical skepticism.* **"Now, I’ve known this man to sell *many* things—doubtful merchandise, questionable advice, and at least one *very* confused goat—but a *ghost*?"** *She shakes her head, laughing as the patrons erupt into laughter and jeers.*

*Leaning in toward Pell, she stage-whispers,* **"Tell me, did this king at least get a receipt? Or was it one of those ‘*as-is*, no refunds’ situations?"** *She winks at Theo.* **"Because if it’s the latter, I’ve got a bridge to sell him next."**

*Then, with a sudden shift, her tone turns sly as she addresses the room.* **"Alright, listen up! Pell here spins his yarn, and *then*—"** *she points at Theo,* **"—*this* old sea dog has to top it. And if he can’t?"** *She grabs a bottle of the good stuff from behind the bar, holding it aloft.* **"Then *I* get to pick the next story. And trust me, *friends*..."** *Her grin turns wicked.* **"You *don’t* want me telling the one about the time Pell here tried to smuggle a *dragon egg* in his coat."**

*The tavern roars with laughter and shouts of encouragement. Mira hops down, landing lightly, and raises her mug.* **"To liars, legends, and the storms that trap us with ‘em!"** *She takes a long drink, her eyes never leaving Pell’s.* **"Now *talk*, Merchant. Before I start charging admission."**"


--- EVENING ---
[The local guard captain visits]
Mood: mysterious

Grom: "*I look up from wiping down the bar as the door creaks open, my hand automatically reaching for the cudgel I keep beneath the counter. The guard captain’s polished boots click against the floorboards, and the usual evening chatter dies down like a snuffed candle. Even Dice stops mid-shuffle of his cards, which is saying something.*

*I don’t smile. Not yet.* **"Captain,"** *I grunt, nodding once. A acknowledgement, not a welcome. My eyes flick to the two guards flanking him—young, tense, hands resting too close to their swords.* **"You’re off your usual route. And your usual *company*."** *I jerk my chin toward Brother Marcus, who’s gone very still in his corner, fingers tightening around his prayer beads.*

*I lean against the bar, arms crossed.* **"So. What’s got the city’s finest slumming it in my tavern? Lost a bet? Or just here to remind us how *lawful* you are?"** *My voice is light, but there’s an edge to it. The Rusty Anchor doesn’t get visits from the guard unless someone’s either bleeding or about to be.*

*I slide a tankard toward the captain, untouched.* **"Drink’s on the house. But the answers aren’t."**

*(OOC: Grom’s tone is wary but not openly hostile—yet. He’s sizing up the situation, testing the captain’s intent, and making it clear this isn’t a social call. Leaves room for the captain to play it straight… or not.)*"

Dice: "*Dice doesn’t so much as twitch when the door opens—her cards freeze mid-shuffle, fingers splayed like a gambler caught cheating. Then, slow as honey dripping from a spoon, she lowers her hands to the table, the deck vanishing into her sleeve with a practiced flick. Her grin doesn’t waver, but her eyes go sharp as dagger points, darting between the captain and his jumpy lackeys.*

**"Well, well,"** *she purrs, leaning back in her chair with a creak of wood.* **"If it isn’t the law, all shiny and *official*."** *She kicks her boots up onto the table, lacing her fingers behind her head like she hasn’t a care in the world.* **"You know, Captain, I was *just* telling Grom here how much I *admire* the city watch. So *efficient*. So *thorough*."** *Her voice drips with false sweetness.* **"Like that time you ‘thoroughly’ missed the smugglers’ tunnel under the docks. Or when you ‘efficiently’ lost three prisoners in one night. *Hmm*."**

*She tilts her head, studying the guards like they’re particularly dull coins she’s considering counterfeiting.* **"But hey, no hard feelings! We’re all just… *public servants*, right?"** *Her grin turns razor-thin.* **"So. Which one of us is *lucky* enough to be your problem tonight? Or—"** *she flicks a card from her sleeve, sending it skittering across the floor toward the captain’s boot,* **"—are you here to *make* one?"**

*(OOC: Dice is walking the line between defiance and mockery, testing the captain’s patience while keeping an escape route open. Ready to bolt, sweet-talk, or throw a distraction if things go south!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's pipe smoke curls lazily in the sudden silence as he slowly lowers his feet from the chair opposite him, the creak of old wood filling the gap left by the tavern's hushed patrons. His milky eye gleams in the lantern light as he studies the guard captain with the quiet intensity of a man who's seen regimes rise and fall over too many tankards of ale.*

**"Ah, Captain,"** *he drawls, his voice rough as ship's timber but carrying easily across the suddenly still room,* **"you've got the timing of a man who's either very brave or very foolish. Or perhaps just very *thirsty*."** *He nods toward the untouched tankard Grom slid across the bar.* **"That one's on Grom. The next one's on *me*—if you can answer a question first."**

*He leans forward, elbows on his knees, his remaining eye locking onto the captain like a harpoon finding its mark.* **"See, I've known every guard captain to walk through that door for the past thirty years. And not one of 'em ever came in *unannounced* unless they were either collecting a debt... or *paying* one."** *He taps his pipe against his palm, the ashes scattering like forgotten secrets.* **"So which is it, Captain? You here to *settle* something? Or just to *stir* it?"**

*His gaze flicks to Dice's card lying at the captain's boot, then back up with a slow, knowing smile.* **"And as for your *men* here..."** *He chuckles, shaking his head.* **"Boys, if you're gonna stand that tense, you might as well just sit down and have a drink. You're making the rest of us *nervous*."**

*He settles back into his chair with a creak, taking a slow drag from his pipe before exhaling a perfect smoke ring toward the rafters.* **"Now. How about that drink, Captain? Or are we gonna keep dancing around whatever *real* business brought you to our humble little rat's nest?"** *His grin is all teeth.* **"Because I've got a story about a guard captain who once tried to arrest the wrong man in this very tavern. Ended up owing him a favor *and* a new pair of boots."** *He winks.* **"Care to hear how it ends?"**"

Brother Marcus: "*Brother Marcus steps forward, his robes whispering against the floor like a prayer half-heard. His hands are folded into the sleeves of his cassock, but his fingers twitch—just once—as if resisting the urge to make the sign of his order. His voice, when it comes, is calm as still water, but there’s a weight to it, like a stone dropped into a well.*

**"Captain."** *A nod, neither deferential nor dismissive.* **"And to you, friends of the Anchor."** *His gaze lingers on Dice’s card at the captain’s boot, then lifts to meet her eyes with something like quiet amusement.* **"A game of chance, then? Or a test of wills?"**

*He turns slightly, addressing the room as much as the captain, his tone measured but carrying the unmistakable authority of a man used to being heard in hushed spaces.* **"I’ve walked these docks long enough to know the Rusty Anchor isn’t just a tavern—it’s a confession box for the city’s secrets. And secrets, like sins, have a way of coming to light when least expected."**

*His attention shifts back to the captain, his expression unreadable but not unkind.* **"You’re not here for ale, and they’re not here for absolution. So let’s dispense with the dance, shall we?"** *A pause. A breath.* **"The city watch and the Anchor have an… *understanding*. One that’s lasted because both sides know when to fold. Tonight, Captain, I suggest you consider your hand carefully."**

*He gestures toward the card at the captain’s feet.* **"That’s not just a card. It’s a question. And the answer will determine whether this ends with a drink… or a debt."** *His voice drops, almost conversational.* **"I’ve buried men who chose poorly. I’d rather not add to the count tonight."**

*Then, softer, as if sharing a confidence:* **"But if you *are* here to settle something… perhaps we might discuss terms. Over that drink Old Theo so generously offered."** *His eyes flick to Theo, then Dice, then back to the captain—a silent signal, a shared understanding.* **"The Anchor has always been a place for… *negotiations*."**

*(OOC: Brother Marcus is playing the mediator, using his moral authority and subtle threats to steer the conversation toward resolution rather than conflict. He’s not picking sides—yet—but he’s making it clear that escalation would be… unwise.)*"

Grom: "*I exhale through my nose, a sound like a bull about to charge—or settle. My fingers drum once against the bar, then still. The captain’s got three men, but we’ve got Theo’s wit, Marcus’ weight, and Dice’s… well, Dice’s *everything else*. And me. Always me.*

*I push off the bar and step forward, not toward the captain, but to the hearth. I grab the poker and jab at the fire, sending up a shower of sparks. The light dances across my tusks as I turn back, slow and deliberate.*

**"Alright,"** *I growl, low and even.* **"Here’s how this *doesn’t* go: You don’t drag my patrons out in irons. We don’t ‘accidentally’ forget to mention which dock your wife’s favorite jeweler uses. And *nobody*—"** *I point the poker at the captain’s two guards, then let it drop with a *clang* against the stones.* **"—ends up in the harbor. Again."**

*I lean the poker against the hearth and fold my arms.* **"Now. You want to talk? *Talk.* You want to drink? *Drink.*"** *I nod at Theo’s untouched tankard.* **"But if you’re here to *play games*…"** *I glance at Dice, then back at the captain, my grin all teeth.* **"You’re in the wrong damn tavern."**

*I jerk my chin toward a corner table, away from prying ears.* **"Four chairs. One’s yours. The other three? For your men—*if* they can sit without their hands twitching."** *I grab a fresh bottle from the bar and set it down with four glasses.* **"Marcus is right. The Anchor’s always been for negotiations. But here’s the thing about negotiations, Captain:"** *I pour the first drink, dark and thick as oil.* **"They work best when everyone *leaves* with something."**

*I slide the glass toward him, then meet his eyes.* **"So. What’re you here to *give*?"**

*(OOC: Grom’s setting the terms—firm, fair, and with just enough threat to remind the captain this isn’t a request. The ball’s in the captain’s court now.)*"


--- LATE NIGHT ---
[A quiet moment between old friends]
Mood: contemplative

Grom: "*I take a slow sip of the whiskey, the burn of it grounding me in the quiet. The tavern’s empty now, just the two of us and the embers in the hearth, casting long shadows that dance like old memories. I set the glass down and lean back in my chair, the wood groaning under my weight. For a moment, I just listen—to the creak of Theo’s rocking chair, the distant lap of water against the docks, the way the night itself seems to breathe.*

*Then, in a voice rougher than usual, I rumble,* **"You ever think about how many stories these walls have heard?"** *I tap the table between us, scarred and stained with years of tankards and tall tales.* **"All the lies, the confessions, the deals made and broken before sunrise."** *I chuckle, low and dry.* **"Hell, Theo, we’ve probably got enough secrets buried in this place to sink a ship."**

*I pour us both another finger of whiskey, the amber liquid catching the firelight.* **"But that’s the thing, ain’t it? The Anchor’s not just a tavern. It’s a… a *place*. For the ones who don’t fit nowhere else."** *I take a slow sip, then meet his gaze.* **"You think that’s why we’re still here? ‘Cause we don’t fit nowhere else neither?"**

*I grin, but there’s something softer in it this time.* **"Or maybe we’re just too damn stubborn to leave."** *I raise my glass.* **"To the Anchor. And the fools who call it home."**"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's rocking chair falls still as he sets down his pipe, the embers glowing like a single watchful eye in the dim firelight. He studies Grom for a long moment, his gnarled fingers tracing the scars on the table between them—each one a story, each one a ghost. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he raises his glass, the whiskey catching the firelight like liquid amber.*

**"Aye, lad,"** *he rumbles, his voice rough as barnacle-crusted timber but soft with something like affection.* **"We’re the fools who don’t fit. The broken, the stubborn, the ones who’ve seen too much to pretend otherwise."** *He chuckles, low and dry, and taps his milky eye socket with a calloused finger.* **"But that’s the beauty of it, ain’t it? The Anchor don’t *want* us to fit. It just wants us to *stay*."**

*He takes a slow sip, savoring the burn, then leans forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.* **"You know why I never left? Not for the gold, not for the glory, not even for the women—though gods know I’ve tried."** *He grins, teeth yellowed but still sharp.* **"It’s ‘cause out there?"** *He jerks his chin toward the door, where the night presses in like a living thing.* **"Out there, you’re just another face in the crowd. But in here?"** *He thumps the table, making the glasses jump.* **"In here, you’re *family*."**

*He settles back, his chair creaking like an old ship’s timbers.* **"And family? Well, family’s got a way of keeping you honest. Even when you don’t *want* to be."** *He raises his glass again, his grin turning sly.* **"So here’s to the Anchor. To the fools, the misfits, and the ones who’ve got nowhere else to go."** *He winks.* **"May we never find a better place."**"

Grom: "*I let out a low, rumbling chuckle, the sound vibrating in my chest like distant thunder. The whiskey in my glass catches the firelight as I raise it, the amber glow matching the warmth in my gut. Theo’s words settle over me like an old, familiar cloak—worn thin in places, but still sturdy enough to keep out the cold.*

**"Family, huh?"** *I grunt, shaking my head with a grin.* **"Funny way of puttin’ it. Most families don’t have this many knives under the table."** *I tap the floorboard with my boot, where I know at least three blades are hidden—Dice’s, mine, and the one Mira keeps "just in case."*

*I take a slow sip, then set the glass down with a solid* **thunk***.* **"But you’re right. Out there?"** *I jerk my chin toward the door, where the night hums with the distant sounds of the city.* **"Out there, you’re just a name. Or a number. Or a problem to be solved."** *I flex my fingers, the old scars on my knuckles catching the light.* **"But in here? You’re *Grom*. Or *Theo*. Or that idiot Dice who still owes me twenty silver from last winter."**

*I lean forward, resting my forearms on the table, the wood groaning under my weight.* **"And yeah, maybe we’re all a little broken. But that’s the thing about broken things, ain’t it?"** *I grin, all teeth.* **"They’re the only ones that let the light in."**

*I raise my glass again, the firelight dancing in the whiskey.* **"To the Anchor. To the fools, the liars, and the lost. May we always have a chair, a drink, and a damn good reason to stay."** *I down the rest in one smooth gulp, then slam the glass down with a laugh.* **"Now. You gonna tell me about that time you tried to leave, or do I have to pry it out of you with a crowbar?"**"

DAY 5: Fifthday
Weather: Blustery winds

Events: The weekly dice tournament, A former patron returns after years away
Visitors: Garret Stone

--- AFTERNOON ---
[The weekly dice tournament]
Mood: casual

Mira: "*Mira leans against the bar, one elbow propped on the counter as she watches the dice tournament unfold. The tavern is alive with the clatter of dice, the shouts of victory, and the groans of defeat. She takes a slow sip from her mug, her sharp eyes scanning the room before landing on Old Theo, who’s holding court at his usual table, a pile of coins in front of him and a triumphant grin on his face.*

**"Well, well,"** *she drawls, raising her voice just enough to carry over the din,* **"looks like Theo’s on a winning streak today. Either that, or he’s finally learned how to cheat without getting caught."** *She grins, nudging a passing server with a tray of drinks.* **"Careful, love—if you spill that on him, we might actually get some *new* stories out of him instead of the same old tall tales."**

*She pushes off the bar, weaving through the crowd with practiced ease, stopping to clap a farmer on the back and wink at a blushing merchant’s daughter. When she reaches Theo’s table, she leans in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur.* **"You know, Theo, if you keep winning like this, someone might actually start believing you’re *good* at this. And then where would we be?"** *She snags a stray piece of bread from his plate, popping it into her mouth with a cheeky grin.* **"Still, can’t complain—full house means full pockets. And *that* means I might just let you win a hand or two later."** *She winks, straightening up as a group of rowdy dockworkers bursts into laughter nearby.* **"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a tavern to run and a fortune to make. Try not to scare off the paying customers, huh?"** *With that, she saunters off, already greeting the next wave of patrons with a charm that’s equal parts warmth and mischief.*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo leans back in his chair with a slow, creaking grin, his remaining eye twinkling as he watches Mira’s retreat. He gathers his winnings with a practiced sweep of his gnarled hand, the coins clinking like a pirate’s treasure. Then, raising his voice just enough to carry over the tavern’s din—but not enough to draw the whole room’s attention—he calls after her:*

**"Ah, Mira, my dear,"** *he rumbles, his voice rich with amusement,* **"you wound me. Here I thought we had an *understanding*—you let me keep my *mysteries*, and I let you keep your *secrets*."** *He taps the side of his nose with one finger, his grin turning sly.* **"But if you’re so sure I’m cheating, why not sit down and *prove* it? Unless…"** *He winks, raising his tankard in a mock toast.* **"Unless you’re afraid I’ll win *your* coins too."**

*He takes a slow sip, then chuckles as he sets the tankard down with a thud.* **"As for scaring off customers?"** *He spreads his hands in mock innocence.* **"Darling, I’m *good* for business. Half this lot’s here *hoping* to hear a new tale. The other half’s here *hoping* to *be* one."** *He leans forward, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial rasp.* **"And if you *do* let me win later? Well, let’s just say I’ll make it worth your while. Maybe even tell you the *real* story about the kraken."** *He winks.* **"The one with the mermaid."**

*Then, raising his voice again, he calls to the room:* **"And as for the rest of you lot—if you’re done losing your coin to an old man, how about a *real* challenge?"** *He slams a fresh stack of coins onto the table.* **"Double or nothing. Winner gets a round on the house—and a story *Mira* hasn’t heard yet."** *The tavern erupts into cheers, and Theo settles back with a satisfied grin, his eye flicking to Mira.* **"Your move, lass. Unless you’d rather keep running the place *without* knowing what really happened to that tax collector…"** *His grin says he already knows the answer.*"

Mira: "*Mira pauses mid-stride, one hand still resting on the shoulder of a laughing dockworker, and turns back toward Theo with a slow, deliberate smile. She raises her own tankard in a mocking toast, her dark eyes glinting with mischief as she lets the silence stretch just long enough to make the room lean in.*

**"Oh, Theo,"** *she purrs, her voice carrying like honeyed venom over the din,* **"if I sat down every time you *claimed* to have a new story, I’d never get any work done. And we both know your ‘real’ kraken tale involves less mermaids and more *bad decisions*."** *She takes a slow sip, letting the laughter ripple through the crowd before continuing.*

*Leaning against a nearby post, she crosses her arms and tilts her head.* **"But since you’re so *generous* with my coins..."** *She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a single gold piece, flipping it between her fingers with a *clink*.* **"Tell you what. You win this hand, and I’ll *personally* buy that round. But if *I* win?"** *Her grin turns sharp.* **"You tell *everyone* here the *real* reason you left the sea. And I don’t mean the kraken."**

*The tavern erupts into gasps and laughter, Theo’s eye narrowing as she tosses the coin onto his table with a *ping*.* **"Deal?"** *She winks, pushing off the post.* **"Or are *you* the one who’s afraid?"**

*Before he can answer, she turns to the room, raising her voice.* **"Alright, you lot! While Theo here decides if he’s brave enough to play, who else wants in? Winner gets *two* rounds on the house—and the honor of hearing Theo *actually* tell the truth for once!"** *The crowd roars as she saunters back to the bar, calling over her shoulder,* **"And Theo? Don’t take *too* long. I’ve got a tavern to run, and you’ve got a reputation to *lose*."**"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's grin doesn't waver as Mira's gold coin spins to a stop on the table, but his remaining eye gleams with the sharp calculation of a man who's spent decades playing this exact game. He reaches out with deliberate slowness, his gnarled fingers closing around the coin before flipping it back toward her with a practiced flick. It lands with a *clink* in her waiting palm, the tavern's collective breath catching in the sudden silence.*

**"Ah, lass,"** *he rumbles, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial growl that carries just far enough,* **"you drive a hard bargain. But then, so do I."** *He leans forward, elbows on the table, the picture of a man about to share a secret.* **"You want the *real* reason I left the sea?"** *His grin turns wolfish.* **"Fine. But you’ll have to *earn* it."**

*With a flourish, he sweeps his winnings back into the center of the table, the coins chiming like a ship's bell.* **"One hand. Winner takes all."** *He taps the table twice, his voice rising to carry over the hushed crowd.* **"But here’s the twist—*you* deal. And if I win?"** *He winks at the room.* **"Mira here sings the *Three-Legged Mermaid* shanty. *All three verses*."**

*The tavern erupts into laughter and cheers, Mira's eyes narrowing as she weighs the stakes. Theo settles back in his chair, pipe smoke curling around him like a shroud.* **"Your move, lass. Unless you’d rather keep wondering about that tax collector…"** *His grin says he knows she won’t back down.* **"Deal?"**"


--- EVENING ---
[A former patron returns after years away]
Mood: tense

Grom: "*I look up from wiping down the bar as the door creaks open, my hand automatically pausing mid-swipe. The years haven't been kind to Garret Stone - his once-broad shoulders are slightly stooped, his face lined with roads I recognize too well. But those eyes... those are the same sharp, restless eyes that used to sit in this very tavern, plotting his next move.*

*For a long moment, I just stare. Then, with deliberate slowness, I set the rag down and plant my fists on the bar. The usual evening chatter dies down as the others notice him too - Dice's cards freeze mid-shuffle, Theo's pipe stalls halfway to his lips, Pell's fingers tighten around his tankard.*

*"Well,"* I rumble, my voice low enough to carry but not loud enough to challenge. *"Look what the tide washed in."* I don't smile. Not yet. *"Garret Stone. Or should I say... whatever name you're using this week?"*

*I jerk my chin toward an empty stool at the bar - not the one he used to favor near the fire, but close enough to keep an eye on. "Sit. If you're here to drink, you'll find the prices haven't changed. If you're here for trouble..."* My gaze flicks to the door, then back. *"You'll find that hasn't changed either."*

*The tension in the room is thick enough to cut with my cudgel, but I keep my voice steady. "What'll it be, Stone? The past or the present?"* I reach for a clean tankard, but my fingers hover over it. *"And more importantly - which one are you running from this time?"*"

Dice: "*Dice's fingers twitch—just once—before her cards vanish back into her deck with a snap. She doesn't look up right away, her gaze lingering on the table like she's counting the scratches in the wood. Then, slow as a gambler revealing a losing hand, she lifts her head, her grin gone feral.*

**"Well, well,"** *she drawls, pushing her chair back with a scrape that sets everyone's teeth on edge.* **"If it isn't the ghost of bad decisions past."** *She saunters toward the bar, hips swaying like she's got all the time in the world, but her eyes never leave Garret. Not for a second.*

*She hops up onto the stool next to him—close enough to smell the road on him, close enough to see the way his knuckles whiten around his cane.* **"Grom, darling,"** *she purrs, not taking her eyes off Garret,* **"pour our *esteemed* guest whatever's cheapest. Unless he's here to settle his old tab?"** *A beat. Then, sweet as poison:* **"You *do* remember your tab, don't you, Stone? Or should I call you... what was it last time? *‘Baron von Something’*?"**

*She leans in, her voice dropping to a whisper only he can hear—though the whole room leans in anyway.* **"You look like hell, by the way. Then again, so do we all."** *She pats his shoulder, too hard to be friendly.* **"So. Which is it? You here to drink, or here to remind us why we *all* left you for dead in that alley?"**

*(OOC: Dice is playing it dangerous—half mocking, half genuinely rattled. She's testing Garret, seeing if he's here to reopen old wounds or dig new ones. Ready to bolt or bait depending on his move!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's pipe, halfway to his lips, freezes in midair as the door creaks open. The smoke curls around his face like a shroud as he watches Garret Stone step inside, his remaining eye narrowing to a slit. For a long moment, he doesn't move, doesn't speak—just watches, his expression unreadable. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he sets his pipe down on the table with a *click*, the embers still glowing like a single watchful eye.*

**"Well, well,"** *he rumbles, his voice rough as barnacle-crusted timber but carrying easily across the suddenly silent tavern,* **"if it isn't the prodigal son, back from the dead. Or at least, back from *somewhere*."** *He leans back in his chair, his gaze flicking to Dice, then to Grom, before settling back on Garret.* **"You know, Stone, I always said you had a knack for making an entrance. Though I *did* expect you to wait a few more years before proving me right."**

*He takes a slow sip of his drink, his eye never leaving Garret's face.* **"Now, I don't know what brings you back to our humble little rat's nest, but I *do* know one thing."** *He taps the side of his nose with one finger, his grin turning sly.* **"You're not here for the ale. So why don't you sit down, have a drink, and tell us what *really* brought you back."** *He nods to Grom, who's still hovering by the bar, his expression unreadable.* **"Grom, pour the man a drink. And Dice?"** *He winks at her, his grin turning wolfish.* **"Why don't you deal us a hand? Let's see if Stone's still got the touch."**

*He settles back in his chair, his gaze never leaving Garret's face.* **"So, Stone. What'll it be? The past or the present?"** *His grin says he already knows the answer.* **"And more importantly—which one are you running *to* this time?"**"

Merchant Pell: "*Merchant Pell doesn't move from his corner booth, but his fingers pause in their methodical polishing of his signet ring. The tavern's sudden tension wraps around him like a familiar cloak—one he's worn in a hundred backroom deals and twice as many betrayals. He takes a slow sip of his wine, the ruby liquid catching the firelight as he sets the glass down with deliberate precision.*

**"Ah, Garret,"** *he murmurs, his voice carrying across the silent room like a blade sliding from its sheath,* **"you always did have impeccable timing. Or is it just that disasters follow you like stray dogs?"** *His lips curl into a smile that doesn't reach his eyes as he rises with the fluid grace of a man who's never been caught off-guard.* **"Last I heard, you were *dead*—or at least, *wishing* you were. Yet here you stand, looking like a man who's either found religion or lost his mind."**

*He steps forward, his polished boots clicking against the floorboards, and stops just out of arm's reach—close enough to study the lines of exhaustion etched into Garret's face, the way his cane trembles slightly under his weight.* **"You're not here for drinks. You're not here for *us*."** *Pell's gaze flicks to the door, then back.* **"So let's dispense with the pleasantries. What's chasing you this time? Debt collectors? A scorned lover? Or—"** *his voice drops to a velvet whisper,* **"—did you finally steal from someone who *matters*?"**

*He reaches into his coat—not for a weapon, but for a small, stoppered vial of amber liquid that glows faintly in the dim light.* **"I have something that might help with that limp. Or that *face*."** *He rolls the vial between his fingers, watching the way Garret's eyes track it.* **"But my prices have gone up since last we met. And I don't accept *promises* anymore."**

*With a sudden, sharp grin, he tosses the vial into the air—and catches it effortlessly.* **"So. Talk. Before I decide you're more valuable as a *warning* than a customer."**

*(OOC: Pell's tone is all silk and steel—charming, dangerous, and *very* much in control. He's not just probing for information; he's setting the terms. Ready for Garret's next move!)*"

Garret Stone: "*Garret Stone doesn’t flinch as the vial arcs through the air—his gaze follows it, sharp as a blade, but his expression remains unreadable. The cane in his grip is steady now, the tremor gone, as if the weight of the room has anchored him. His free hand drifts to the inside of his coat, fingers brushing the hilt of a dagger hidden there—not in threat, but in habit. Old instincts die hard.*

**"Pell,"** *he says, voice low, rough with disuse or something darker,* **"still peddling snake oil to desperate men, I see."** *A ghost of a smirk tugs at the corner of his mouth, but it doesn’t reach his eyes.* **"And here I thought you’d have moved up in the world by now. Guess some rats prefer the sewer."**

*He shifts his weight, the cane tapping once against the floorboards—a deliberate sound, like a metronome counting down.* **"As for what’s chasing me?"** *His laugh is a dry, humorless thing.* **"You always did have a flair for the dramatic. But if you’re so eager to know, ask yourself this—why would a man who’s *supposed* to be dead walk back into a place like this unless he had no other choice?"**

*His gaze flicks to Theo, then back to Pell, lingering on the vial.* **"That limp? A gift from a man who thought I owed him more than I was willing to pay. The face?"** *He touches his cheek, where a scar cuts through the stubble.* **"A reminder that some debts aren’t settled with coin."**

*He steps forward—just one pace, but it’s enough to close the distance between them. The tavern’s silence presses in, thick as fog.* **"I’m not here for your potions, Pell. And I’m not here to play cards with Theo."** *His voice drops, barely above a whisper.* **"I’m here because someone’s digging up old graves. And if I don’t stop them, they’ll bury us all in the process."**

*He leans in, just slightly, his breath warm against Pell’s ear.* **"So tell me—do you still deal in information, or just in threats?"** *He pulls back, his grin razor-thin.* **"Because I’ve got coin. And I’ve got names. But I won’t waste either on a man who’s forgotten how to listen."**

*(OOC: Garret’s playing it cool, but there’s an edge to him—like a coiled spring. He’s not here to beg, and he’s not here to run. He’s here because he’s out of options, and he’s betting these two are the only ones who might understand what’s coming. Ready for their reactions!)*"


--- LATE NIGHT ---
[Sharing secrets over the last drink]
Mood: melancholy

Old Theo: "*Old Theo exhales a slow plume of pipe smoke, watching it curl toward the rafters like a ghost escaping its grave. The tavern is empty now except for the two of them, the fire reduced to embers, and the last dregs of whiskey in their glasses catching the dim light like liquid amber. He doesn’t speak at first—just listens to the creak of the old building settling, the distant lap of water against the docks, and the way Dice’s fingers tap restlessly against her glass.*

*Then, in a voice rougher than usual, he rumbles:*

**"You ever notice how the best secrets are the ones we don’t *mean* to keep?"** *He taps the rim of his glass with a gnarled finger, the sound like a quiet confession.* **"The ones that slip out when the night’s too long and the drink’s too strong."** *He chuckles, low and dry, but there’s no humor in it.* **"Funny thing, though. The more you try to bury ‘em, the louder they scream."**

*He takes a slow sip, then sets the glass down with a thud.* **"So. What’s yours, lass? The one you’ve been carrying like a dagger in your boot?"** *His remaining eye gleams in the firelight, sharp as a gambler’s blade.* **"Or are we just gonna sit here and pretend we’re not both drowning in the same damn ocean?"**

*He leans back, the chair creaking like an old ship’s timbers.* **"I’ll go first, if it’ll make you feel better."** *He exhales, the words coming slow and heavy.* **"Ever wonder why I never talk about the *real* reason I left the sea?"** *He taps his milky eye socket.* **"It’s not ‘cause I lost this. It’s ‘cause I *took* it."** *A beat. Then, quieter:* **"And the man who gave it to me? He didn’t *have* a choice."**

*The silence stretches, thick as fog. Then, with a sudden sharpness, he nods at her glass.* **"Your turn, Dice. Or do I have to drag it out of you like a bad tooth?"** *His grin is all teeth.* **"Either way, I’m not leaving this table till one of us bleeds."**"

Dice: "*Dice's fingers still against the glass. The restless tapping dies. For a heartbeat, she's perfectly still—like a rabbit that's just heard the snap of a twig. Then, slow as a gambler revealing a losing hand, she exhales through her nose, a sound that's half-laugh, half-something sharper.*

**"Damn you, Theo."** *Her voice is softer than usual, rough around the edges like unpolished silver.* **"You always did know where to stick the knife."** *She swirls the whiskey in her glass, watching the amber liquid catch the firelight like a trapped secret.* **"Fine. You want a story?"** *She knocks back the rest of her drink in one sharp swallow, then slams the glass down hard enough to make the table shudder.* **"Here’s one for you."*

*She leans forward, elbows on the table, her grin gone feral.* **"Ever hear of the *Luck of the Liar*?"** *Her fingers trace the rim of her empty glass like she's counting sins.* **"No? That’s ‘cause it’s not a ship. It’s a *man*. Or it *was*."** *A beat. Then, quieter:* **"He was my mentor. Taught me every trick I know—how to cheat death, how to cheat the devil, how to cheat *myself* into thinking I was something more than a thief with a silver tongue."**

*She laughs, but there's no humor in it.* **"Funny thing, though. The best liars? They always believe their own lies. And he *believed* he could trust me."** *Her fingers curl into a fist.* **"So when the city guard came knocking, looking for the man who’d swindled half the nobility blind? I *gave* him to them. Walked right into his room, kissed him on the cheek, and slipped the evidence into his pocket myself."** *She taps her chest, right over her heart.* **"And you know what the bastard did?"**

*Her voice drops to a whisper.* **"He *smiled*. Said he was proud of me."** *She barks out a laugh, sharp as broken glass.* **"That’s the thing about monsters, Theo. They *know* what they are. And they *love* making more."**

*She pushes her glass away, her grin returning—but it’s all teeth now, no warmth.* **"So yeah. I’ve got secrets. I’ve got *scars*. But I’ll be damned if I let ‘em *own* me."** *She leans back, matching his posture, her chair creaking in protest.* **"Your turn, old man. Who’d you *really* take that eye from?"** *Her gaze is a challenge, a dare.* **"Or are we done bleeding for the night?"**

*(OOC: Dice is raw here—vulnerable, but still dangerous. She’s matching Theo’s energy, but she’s also testing him, seeing if he’ll flinch. Ready to pivot if he pushes back or if the moment shifts!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's grin fades like smoke in a stiff wind. He sits forward slowly, the chair groaning under his weight, and reaches for the whiskey bottle with a hand that trembles just enough to betray him. He pours two fingers into Dice's empty glass, then two more into his own, the amber liquid sloshing like restless waves.*

**"The *Luck of the Liar*, huh?"** *His voice is a gravel road, rough with something like respect.* **"Sounds like a man who knew the game too well."** *He takes a slow sip, then sets the glass down with a click.* **"But you’re wrong about one thing, lass. Monsters don’t *make* monsters."** *He taps his eye socket again, harder this time.* **"They just *find* ‘em."**

*He leans back, the firelight carving deep shadows into the lines of his face.* **"His name was Elias Veyne. First mate on the *Black Dawn*. Best navigator the Seven Seas ever saw—could read the stars like a lover’s letters."** *His remaining eye glints, sharp as a cutlass.* **"And the worst kind of fool. Thought he could outrun his past."**

*A long pause. The embers pop in the hearth.* **"He was running from a debt. Not gold—*blood*. A nobleman’s daughter, left ruined in Port Veyne. The kind of ruin that gets a man hanged, if the wrong people catch wind."** *His fingers tighten around his glass.* **"I caught wind."**

*He knocks back the whiskey in one burn.* **"Didn’t even fight when I took his eye. Just laughed, like you said your mentor did. Called it ‘fair payment’ for the years he’d bought."** *His voice drops to a rasp.* **"Then he walked off the plank like it was a Sunday stroll. Never even looked back."**

*The silence hangs heavy. Then, quieter:* **"I kept the eye in a jar for years. Till the glass broke one stormy night."** *He chuckles, but it’s a hollow sound.* **"Funny thing—once it was gone, I couldn’t remember his face no more. Just the *sound* of him laughing as the sharks took him."**

*He refills both glasses without asking.* **"So no, Dice. We’re not done bleeding."** *He raises his glass, the firelight turning the whiskey to liquid fire.* **"But we *are* done running."** *The challenge in his gaze is raw, unflinching.* **"Drink up. Dawn’s coming, and it’s got a habit of making liars of us all."**"


======================================================================
DAY 6: Sixthday
Weather: Overcast
======================================================================

Events: A proposal happens in the tavern, Live music and dancing

--- MORNING ---
[Quiet morning coffee before customers arrive]
Mood: peaceful

Old Theo: "*Old Theo sits in his usual corner, the morning light slanting through the windows and turning his pipe smoke to silver. He's already got a mug of coffee in hand—black as a smith's apron and strong enough to wake the dead—his remaining eye half-lidded as he watches Mira and Grom move about the tavern with the easy rhythm of people who've done this dance a thousand times before.*

*He takes a slow sip, then exhales a contented sigh, the sound like a ship settling into calm waters.* **"Ah, mornings,"** *he rumbles, his voice rough but warm.* **"The only time this place is quiet enough to hear yourself think."** *He chuckles, tapping his pipe against the armrest.* **"Though I’d wager half of what goes on in here *shouldn’t* be thought about too hard."**

*He nods to Grom, who’s wiping down the bar with a practiced ease.* **"You’re looking *almost* civilized this morning, lad. Did you finally sleep in a bed, or just pass out in the rain barrel again?"** *His grin is all teeth, but there’s no real bite to it.* **"And Mira?"** *He raises his mug in a mock toast.* **"You’re up early. Either business is *very* good, or you’re avoiding someone *very* persistent."**

*He settles back in his chair, the rocking resuming with a rhythmic creak.* **"Either way, I’ll take it. A quiet morning’s a rare thing in this place."** *He takes another sip, then nods to the door, where the first hints of the day’s bustle are starting to stir.* **"Though I’d enjoy it more if I knew it’d last."** *He winks.* **"But then, where’s the fun in that?"**"

Mira: "*Mira pauses mid-step, a rag in one hand and a half-empty tankard in the other, and turns to Theo with a smirk that’s equal parts affection and mischief. She leans against the bar, her dark eyes glinting in the morning light as she watches him exhale another slow curl of pipe smoke.*

**"Oh, Theo,"** *she drawls, her voice warm but laced with teasing,* **"if I were avoiding someone, you’d be the *first* to know—mostly because you’d be the one hiding them in the rain barrel."** *She sets the tankard down with a *clink* and tosses the rag onto the counter, crossing her arms.* **"But no, business *is* good. So good, in fact, that I’m considering raising the prices just to see how long it takes for you to complain."**

*She pushes off the bar and saunters over to his table, snagging his coffee mug and taking a sip before he can protest.* **"As for the quiet?"** *She grins, handing it back.* **"Enjoy it while it lasts. I’ve got a feeling today’s going to be *interesting*."** *She nods toward the door, where the first of the morning’s patrons are starting to trickle in.* **"And by ‘interesting,’ I mean ‘loud, messy, and probably involving at least one bar fight.’"**

*She winks, turning back toward the bar.* **"But hey, that’s why we’re here, right? To keep things *lively*."** *She raises her voice just enough to carry to Grom,* **"And *you*—if you *did* sleep in the rain barrel, I don’t want to know. Some mysteries are better left unsolved."** *She laughs, already moving to greet the first customers of the day.* **"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a tavern to run and a fortune to make. Try not to scare off the paying customers, huh?"** *Her grin says she already knows he won’t.*"

Grom: "*I finish wiping down the bar with a final, deliberate swipe, then toss the rag over my shoulder where it lands with a damp *thwack* against the wall. The morning banter between Theo and Mira wraps around me like an old, familiar cloak—one that’s seen too many brawls but still keeps out the cold. I lean against the bar, arms crossed, and watch Mira work the room with that effortless charm of hers. The woman could sell sand to a desert merchant and have them thanking her for the deal.*

*Then, with a grunt that’s half-laugh, half-grumble, I call out to Theo without turning around,* **"Rain barrel’s got better company than my bed most nights, old man. At least the barrel don’t snore."** *I reach under the counter and pull out a fresh mug, pouring myself a coffee black enough to strip paint. The steam curls up, carrying the sharp, bitter scent that promises to kick the last of the sleep from my bones.*

*I take a slow sip, then nod toward Mira as she greets the first customers—already laughing at something one of the dockworkers said.* **"She’s right, you know,"** *I say to Theo, my voice low but carrying across the quiet tavern.* **"Today *will* be interesting."** *I set the mug down with a solid* **clunk** *and flex my fingers, the old scars on my knuckles catching the morning light.* **"But then, every day here is. That’s why we keep coming back, ain’t it?"**

*I push off the bar and grab a tray of clean tankards, heading toward the shelves behind the counter.* **"Now, if you two are done yapping about my sleep habits, I’ve got work to do. Unless you’d rather help me restock, Theo?"** *I raise an eyebrow, already knowing the answer.* **"Didn’t think so. Then shut your trap and enjoy the quiet while it lasts."** *I grin, all teeth, as the first real burst of laughter erupts from the growing crowd near the door.* **"Because in about five minutes, this place is gonna sound like a damn menagerie. And I *know* you love that."**"


--- AFTERNOON ---
[A proposal happens in the tavern]
Mood: curious

Mira: "*Mira is polishing a glass behind the bar when the sudden hush falls over the tavern. She looks up sharply, her rag pausing mid-swipe as she spots the young sailor down on one knee, holding out a ring to his blushing sweetheart. The entire room seems to be holding its breath—even Dice, who’s frozen mid-shuffle of his cards, his usual smirk replaced by wide-eyed surprise.*

*Mira sets the glass down with a quiet *clink* and leans forward, her elbows on the bar, watching the scene unfold with a soft smile. When the woman gasps and nods, the tavern erupts into cheers and stomping boots. Mira claps her hands together, her voice ringing out over the noise:*

**"Well, well! Looks like we’ve got ourselves a celebration!"** *She grabs a bottle of the good stuff from under the bar and pours two generous glasses, sliding them toward Dice.* **"On the house—for the happy couple! And Dice—"** *she nods at him,* **"—if you’ve got any sense, you’ll deal them a winning hand. Love’s lucky, but a little extra help never hurt."**

*She hops over the bar with a laugh, weaving through the crowd to clap the sailor on the back.* **"Congratulations, you fool. You’ve just signed up for a lifetime of adventure—and trust me, *that’s* the easy part."** *She winks at the bride-to-be.* **"And you—welcome to the family. First round’s on *me*."**

*As the tavern erupts into song and laughter, Mira leans against the bar again, her eyes twinkling as she watches the couple. She raises her voice just enough to carry to Dice:* **"You know, this place sees a lot of things—fights, bets, bad decisions—but this?"** *She shakes her head, grinning.* **"This might be the best one yet."**"

Dice: "*Dice blinks at the glasses Mira slides toward him, then at the couple now locked in a kiss as the tavern erupts around them. His usual smirk falters, just for a heartbeat, before he schools his face into something dangerously close to sincere. He pushes one of the glasses toward the happy pair with a flourish, then raises his own in a mock toast—though his voice carries an edge of something uncharacteristically soft.*

**"To the fools in love,"** *he drawls, but there’s no bite to it. Just... observation.* **"May your pockets stay full, your lies stay sweet, and your partner *never* learn how to count cards."** *He takes a sip, then sets the glass down with a sharp *clink*, his fingers drumming against the bar.*

*He watches the couple for a long moment, his expression unreadable, before turning back to Mira with a shrug.* **"You’re right. This *is* the best thing this place has seen in a while."** *He leans in, voice dropping to a murmur.* **"But mark my words, Mira—by this time next year, one of ‘em will be in here drowning their sorrows, and the other will be out there drowning in debt."** *He jerks his chin toward the door.* **"That’s not cynicism. That’s *math*."**

*Then, with a grin that’s all teeth and no warmth, he snatches up the deck of cards and fans them out in a sharp arc.* **"Now. Who’s got the coin to bet on *how long* this lasts? I’ll give you three-to-one odds it’s less than a year."** *He winks.* **"And if I’m wrong? Well. I’ll buy the next round."**

*(OOC: Dice is playing it cool, but there’s a hint of something almost... wistful? Or maybe just resigned. He’s not *bitter*, exactly—just practical. Ready to pivot if someone calls his bluff or if the mood shifts!)*"

Mira: "*Mira snatches the deck of cards from Dice’s hands with a speed that makes him blink, her fingers deftly shuffling them into a neat stack before sliding them into her apron pocket. She leans in, her dark eyes glinting with mischief as she rests her elbows on the bar, her voice low but laced with steel.*

**"Oh, Dice,"** *she purrs, her grin sharp enough to cut glass,* **"if I let you take bets on love, I’d have to charge you rent for all the space your *cynicism* takes up in my tavern."** *She taps the side of her nose, her expression turning sly.* **"Besides, I’ve seen you deal. You’d rig the odds before the first coin hits the table."**

*She straightens, grabbing a rag and wiping down the bar with deliberate slowness, her voice carrying just enough to reach the couple—who are now tangled in a kiss that’s drawing wolf whistles from the crowd.* **"But since you’re so *eager* to gamble..."** *She turns back to Dice, her grin turning wicked.* **"How about this? You *don’t* take that bet. And if they’re *still* together next year?"** *She leans in, lowering her voice to a whisper.* **"I’ll give you a *real* challenge. Something even *you* can’t cheat."**

*Before he can protest, she raises her voice, calling to the room:* **"Alright, you lot! Drinks are on *me* for the next hour—** *she winks at the couple,* **"—in honor of love, bad decisions, and the fools who believe in both!"** *The tavern erupts into cheers, and Mira laughs, already pouring another round.* **"And Dice?"** *She slides his glass back toward him, her grin softening just a fraction.* **"Drink up. Even *you* could use a little hope."**"

Dice: "*Dice watches Mira pocket his cards with a raised eyebrow, his fingers twitching like a gambler denied his deck. But then—something shifts. The usual retort dies on his lips. Instead, he exhales sharply through his nose, a sound that might be a laugh if it weren’t so raw. He picks up the glass Mira slides back, swirling the amber liquid like it holds answers.*

**"A challenge I can’t cheat?"** *He scoffs, but there’s no bite to it. Just... curiosity.* **"Now *that’s* a bet I’d take."** *He knocks back the drink in one smooth motion, then slams the glass down—harder than necessary.* **"Fine. No wagers on the lovebirds. But if they *do* make it a year?"** *He leans in, his grin turning sharp as a blade’s edge.* **"I want *your* deck. The one you keep under the bar. The one with the—"** *he mimics a card flip, his voice dropping to a whisper,* **"—*special* queen of hearts."**

*He straightens, rolling his shoulders like he’s shaking off a bad hand.* **"And if they don’t?"** *He shrugs, but there’s a flicker in his eyes—something almost like relief.* **"Then I’ll owe you a story. A *true* one."** *He taps his chest, right over his heart.* **"No lies. No tricks. Just... whatever’s in here."**

*He turns away before Mira can respond, waving a hand dismissively.* **"But don’t hold your breath, Mira. I’ve seen *you* in love. Even *hope* has limits."** *He hops off the stool, already scanning the room for his next mark.* **"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a tavern full of drunkards to fleece. *Some* of us have to earn our keep."**

*(OOC: Dice is playing along, but there’s a crack in the armor—just a hairline fracture. He’s not *bitter*, but he’s not *convinced* either. Ready to pivot if Mira pushes or if the mood shifts!)*"


--- EVENING ---
[Live music and dancing]
Mood: mysterious

Grom: "*I lean against the bar, arms crossed, watching the tavern pulse with music and movement. The fiddle player’s bow flies like a drunk swallow, and the dancers—some graceful, some just enthusiastic—kick up sawdust in time to the beat. Dice is already in the thick of it, spinning some wide-eyed dockworker’s daughter like she’s made of silk instead of bones. Theo’s got his pipe clamped between his teeth, tapping his foot in time, and Pell’s nursing a drink in the corner, his sharp eyes missing nothing.*

*I take a slow pull from my tankard, the ale bitter and cold, then set it down with a thud. The music swells, the room hums, but there’s something else in the air tonight—something that prickles the hairs on the back of my neck. A tension, like a drawn bowstring.*

*I push off the bar and step into the crowd, my size parting the dancers like a ship’s prow through water. I clap a hand on Dice’s shoulder mid-spin, halting him like a puppet with cut strings.* **"Oi. You feel that?"** *I don’t have to explain. Dice’s grin falters for half a heartbeat before he schools it back into place.*

*I jerk my chin toward the door, where the shadows seem thicker than they should be.* **"Something’s off. Pell’s got his ‘I’m counting coins but really counting exits’ face on, and Theo’s not even *trying* to hide he’s got a knife under that coat."** *I lower my voice, though the music’s loud enough to cover it.* **"You see anything… *unusual* tonight?"**

*I don’t wait for an answer. Instead, I turn and raise my voice, booming over the fiddle:* **"Alright, you lot! Next round’s on the house—if you can *outdrink* the musician!"** *The crowd roars, the tension snapping like a too-tight string as they surge toward the bar. I catch Theo’s eye and nod toward the door. He nods back, subtle as a blade slipping between ribs.*

*Then I grab a fresh tankard and raise it high.* **"To Sixthday! May the music be loud, the ale be strong, and the *trouble* be someone else’s!"** *The room erupts in cheers, but my eyes stay on the door.*

*Because trouble’s here. And I *know* it’s ours.*

*(OOC: Grom’s using the chaos of the celebration to mask his vigilance—keeping the crowd distracted while he and the others prepare for whatever’s coming. The mood’s still lively, but the undercurrent of danger is unmistakable.)*"

Dice: "*Dice stumbles slightly as Grom's hand clamps down on his shoulder, his usual grace faltering for just a second. The dockworker's daughter giggles, thinking it's part of the dance, but Dice's eyes flick to the door—then narrow. His grin returns, but it's all teeth now, no warmth.*

**"Feel that?"** *He scoffs, spinning the girl one last time before depositing her safely near her friends with a flourish.* **"I feel like someone’s about to lose a *lot* of money."** *He leans in close to Grom, his voice a low murmur beneath the music.* **"Three shadowy figures by the door. One’s got a limp—old injury, left leg. Another’s got a scar running from his ear to his jaw. And the third?"** *He smirks.* **"He’s the one you *really* want to watch. Too still. Like a snake waiting to strike."**

*He snatches a tankard from a passing tray and raises it high, his voice ringing out over the crowd.* **"To Grom’s generosity! And to the *fools* who think they can outdrink a musician!"** *The crowd cheers, and Dice uses the distraction to slip a dagger from his sleeve, palming it smoothly.* **"I’ll keep ‘em distracted. You and Theo handle the *welcome committee*."** *He winks, then turns back to the crowd, his voice loud and cheerful.* **"Now, who’s ready to *lose*?"**

*But his eyes stay on the door. Because trouble’s here. And Dice? He *loves* trouble.*

*(OOC: Dice is playing the crowd, but he’s ready for a fight. He’s giving Grom and Theo the info they need while keeping the tension high. Ready to pivot if the fight starts or if someone calls his bluff!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo doesn't move from his corner, but his pipe smoke suddenly stills in the air as if the wind itself has held its breath. His remaining eye flicks to the door, then to Grom, then to Dice—each glance sharp as a blade's edge. He takes a slow, deliberate pull from his tankard, then sets it down with a *click* that cuts through the music like a gunshot.*

**"Ah, lads,"** *he rumbles, his voice carrying just enough to reach Grom and Dice over the din,* **"you’re both right. And you’re both *wrong*."** *He taps his pipe against the armrest, the ashes scattering like forgotten secrets.* **"Those three at the door? They’re not here for *us*."** *His grin turns wolfish.* **"They’re here for *him*."**

*He jerks his chin toward Pell, who’s still nursing his drink in the corner, his sharp eyes missing nothing.* **"And Pell?"** *He chuckles, low and dark.* **"Pell’s been expecting them."** *He leans forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial rasp.* **"The limp’s from a bar fight in Port Veyne. The scar’s from a knife fight in the Black Docks. And the third?"** *He winks.* **"He’s the one who *lost* the knife fight."**

*He settles back in his chair, his grin turning sly.* **"So here’s what we’re gonna do. Grom, you keep the crowd *happy*. Dice, you keep the crowd *drunk*. And me?"** *He pats the knife under his coat.* **"I’ll keep the *peace*."** *He raises his tankard in a mock toast.* **"To Sixthday. May the music be loud, the ale be strong, and the *blood* be someone else’s."** *His grin says he already knows the answer.* **"Now. Let’s give ‘em a show."**"

Merchant Pell: "*Merchant Pell doesn't so much as twitch at Theo's revelation, his posture remaining as relaxed as if they were discussing the price of tea. But his fingers—those betray him, tapping a slow, deliberate rhythm against his thigh as he finally turns his head toward the door. His gaze lingers on the three figures, assessing, calculating, before he exhales a slow, amused breath through his nose.*

**"Ah, Theo,"** *he murmurs, his voice carrying just enough to reach the old pirate's ears over the din,* **"you always did have a flair for the dramatic. But you're not *wrong*."** *He takes a final sip of his drink, then sets the glass down with a soft *click*, his signet ring glinting in the firelight.* **"Though I *do* wish you'd let me finish my wine before announcing my guests."**

*He rises with the fluid grace of a man who's never been caught off-guard, straightening his cuffs with deliberate care.* **"The limp? A *gift* from a disgruntled business partner in Port Veyne. The scar? A *reminder* from a man who thought he could cheat me in the Black Docks."** *His lips curl into a smile that doesn't reach his eyes.* **"And the third? Ah, *him* I hired myself. A man who knows the value of patience."**

*He steps forward, his polished boots clicking against the floorboards, and stops just short of the three figures.* **"Gentlemen,"** *he says, his voice smooth as silk but edged with steel,* **"you're late. And you’ve made a *mess* of my evening."** *He gestures to the tavern, where Dice is still spinning tales and Grom is keeping the crowd roaring.* **"But since you're here..."** *He reaches into his coat and pulls out a small, ornate key, twirling it between his fingers.* **"Let’s discuss *business*."**

*He turns back to Theo, his grin sharp as a blade.* **"And Theo? If you *must* keep the peace..."** *He tosses the key into the air and catches it effortlessly.* **"Try not to *break* anything. I *like* this tavern."**

*(OOC: Pell's tone is all charm and danger—he's not just in control; he's *enjoying* it. Ready for the next move, whether it's a fight or a deal!)*"

Grom: "*I crack my knuckles against the bar with a sound like dry kindling snapping, then grab a fresh cask of ale and hoist it onto the counter with a* **thud** *that makes the glasses jump. The music’s still loud, the crowd still laughing, but my ears are tuned to the tension humming under it all like a plucked bowstring.*

*I don’t look at Pell or his "guests." Not yet. Instead, I slap the cask’s tap open and start pouring drinks with deliberate speed, my voice carrying over the din like a drumbeat:* **"Alright, you lot! Who’s thirsty? First five tankards are *free*—if you can catch ‘em!"** *I slide the first one down the bar with practiced force, sending it skidding into the waiting hands of a grinning sailor. The crowd roars, surging forward like a wave.*

*Then, without turning, I call out to Pell, my voice low but cutting through the noise:* **"You want *business*? Fine. But you do it *my* way."** *I jerk my chin toward the back room, where the door’s slightly ajar, the flickering lantern light just visible.* **"In there. Where the *real* deals get made."** *I finally glance over my shoulder, my grin all teeth.* **"And Theo’s right—*I* keep the crowd happy. But that don’t mean I won’t *break* something if I have to."**

*I grab a rag and start wiping down the bar with slow, deliberate strokes, my eyes never leaving Pell’s.* **"So. You gonna talk? Or you gonna *bleed*?"** *I lean in, my voice dropping to a growl only he can hear.* **"Either way, the Anchor gets paid."**

*Then I straighten up, raise my voice, and slap the bar again.* **"Next round’s on *Pell*! Drink up, you beautiful bastards!"** *The crowd cheers, oblivious, as I watch Pell’s next move with the patience of a predator.*

*(OOC: Grom’s keeping the crowd distracted while making it clear—this is *his* tavern, *his* rules. Pell can play along, or he can learn why the Anchor’s stood this long.)*"


--- LATE NIGHT ---
[Reflecting on the day's events]
Mood: intimate

Mira: "*Mira sits at the bar, her fingers tracing the rim of her half-empty glass. The tavern is nearly empty now, the last of the patrons having stumbled out into the night. The only sound is the soft crackle of the dying fire and the occasional creak of the old building settling. She glances at Theo, who is polishing a mug with a slow, methodical motion. There's a quiet understanding between them, a shared history that doesn't need words.*

*She takes a sip of her drink, the liquid burning slightly as it goes down. "You know, Theo," she says softly, her voice barely above a whisper, "I've been thinking about the past. About the choices we've made, the paths we've taken."* *She pauses, her gaze fixed on the amber liquid in her glass.* **"Do you ever wonder if things could have been different? If we had made other choices, taken other roads?"**

*She looks up at him, her eyes reflecting the flickering firelight.* **"I don't regret much, but sometimes... sometimes I wonder."* *She takes another sip, the silence between them comfortable, filled with unspoken thoughts and shared memories.* **"But then I look around, at this place, at the people we've met, the lives we've touched, and I think... maybe it's all exactly as it should be."*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo sets down the mug he's polishing with a soft *clink*, the cloth still moving in slow circles as if by habit. His remaining eye studies Mira over the rim of his own glass, the firelight catching the deep lines of his face like a map of all the roads not taken. He takes a slow sip, the whiskey burning like old memories, then exhales through his nose—a sound like waves retreating from shore.*

**"Ah, lass,"** *he rumbles, his voice rough but warm, like well-worn leather,* **"you’re asking the wrong question."** *He taps the bar between them with a gnarled finger, the wood scarred by decades of tankards and tall tales.* **"It’s not about whether things *could’ve* been different. It’s about whether they *should’ve*."**

*He leans forward, the chair creaking like an old ship’s timbers.* **"I’ve sailed enough seas to know—every choice is a current. You can fight it, or you can ride it, but either way, it’ll take you *somewhere*."** *His grin turns wry.* **"And most of the time, that ‘somewhere’ is exactly where you *need* to be, even if it’s not where you *wanted*."**

*He raises his glass, the firelight turning the whiskey to liquid amber.* **"But you’re right about one thing."** *His voice drops to a rasp, the words heavy with the weight of years.* **"This place? These people?"** *He nods toward the empty tavern, where the echoes of laughter still linger in the rafters.* **"They’re the *why*. The reason the roads we took were worth the walking."**

*A long pause. The fire pops, sending up a shower of sparks.* **"So no, Mira. I don’t wonder."** *He knocks back the rest of his drink in one burn.* **"I *know*."** *He sets the glass down with a thud.* **"And so do you."**

*He pushes off the bar, his chair scraping against the floorboards.* **"Now. How about we stop philosophizing like a couple of drunken poets and get some *real* work done?"** *He winks, grabbing a fresh bottle from under the counter.* **"The night’s not over yet, and neither are we."**"

Mira: "*Mira watches Theo for a long moment, the firelight flickering in her dark eyes as she absorbs his words. Then, with a slow smile, she pushes her own glass aside and hops off the barstool, landing lightly on her feet. She grabs two fresh tankards from under the counter and slides one toward Theo with a *clink*.*

**"You old sea dog,"** *she murmurs, her voice warm with affection,* **"always steering the conversation back to work."** *She raises her tankard in a mock toast, her grin turning wicked.* **"But you’re right. The night’s not over yet."**

*She takes a slow sip, then sets the tankard down with a decisive thud.* **"Alright. Let’s get to it."** *She grabs a rag and starts wiping down the bar with brisk efficiency, her movements sharp and practiced.* **"But Theo?"** *She glances at him, her eyes glinting with mischief.* **"Next time you want to philosophize, do it *after* we’ve closed up. I’ve got a feeling you’d be a lot more poetic with a few more drinks in you."**

*She laughs, the sound ringing out in the quiet tavern.* **"And who knows? Maybe one of these nights, you’ll finally tell me the *real* story about the kraken."** *She winks, already moving to the next task.* **"But for now? Let’s get this place ready for tomorrow. Because if there’s one thing I *know*..."** *She grins, raising her tankard again.* **"It’s that the best stories are the ones we haven’t lived yet."**"


======================================================================
DAY 7: Seventhday
Weather: Overcast
======================================================================

Events: A quiet, reflective day, Only regulars at the bar

--- MORNING ---
[Discussing yesterday's events]
Mood: peaceful

Grom: "*I lean back in my chair, the morning sun slanting through the windows and turning my tankard of coffee into a pool of dark gold. The tavern’s quiet—just the two of us, the creak of Theo’s rocking chair, and the distant cry of gulls over the harbor. I take a slow sip, the bitter warmth grounding me after last night’s chaos, then set the mug down with a satisfied grunt.*

*"Well,"* I rumble, stretching my arms behind my head until my joints pop, *"that could’ve gone worse."* I glance at Theo, my grin slow and knowing. *"Pell’s still breathing, the tavern’s still standing, and Dice only lost *one* knife in the scuffle."* I chuckle, shaking my head. *"Call that a win."*

*I reach for the pot and pour us both another round, the rich scent of coffee mingling with the salt air drifting in from the docks.* *"You ever think about how…"* I pause, searching for the right words, *"…how *normal* this is?"* I gesture between us—the quiet, the coffee, the way the light catches the scars on the old wooden table. *"One night we’re dodging knives and broken deals, the next we’re sittin’ here like it’s just another morning."*

*I take another sip, then lean forward, elbows on the table.* *"But that’s the thing, ain’t it? It *is* just another morning. And we’re still here."* I raise my mug in a silent toast, my voice rough but warm. *"To the Anchor. To the fools who keep it standing. And to the fact that, somehow, we’re still *alive* to talk about it."*

*I drink deep, then set the mug down with a thud.* *"Now. You gonna tell me what *really* happened with Pell’s boys, or do I have to pry it out of you with a crowbar?"* My grin turns sly. *"And don’t say ‘nothing.’ I saw the blood on your sleeve."*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's rocking chair falls still as he sets down his mug with a slow, deliberate motion. The morning light catches the fresh tear in his sleeve—just a thin line, but dark with dried blood—and he fingers it absently, his grin turning wry. He takes a long, slow sip of coffee, the steam curling around his face like a ghost of last night's chaos, then exhales through his nose with a sound like waves retreating from shore.*

**"Ah, lad,"** *he rumbles, his voice rough but warm,* **"you always did have a knack for cutting straight to the bone."** *He leans forward, elbows on the table, the wood groaning under his weight.* **"Pell’s boys?"** *He chuckles, low and dry.* **"Let’s just say they came looking for a reckoning. Found one instead."**

*He taps the rim of his mug with a gnarled finger, the sound like a quiet confession.* **"The limp one? Broke his nose on my fist. The scarred one? Lost a tooth to Dice’s dagger—*after* he lost the knife fight."** *His grin turns wolfish.* **"And the third?"** *He shrugs, picking at the bloodstain on his sleeve.* **"Let’s just say he won’t be troubling Pell—or us—again."**

*A beat. The gulls cry outside, the sound sharp and wild.* **"But you’re right about one thing."** *His voice drops to a rasp, the words heavy with the weight of years.* **"It *is* just another morning. And we’re still here."** *He raises his mug, the firelight turning the coffee to liquid gold.* **"To the Anchor. To the fools who keep it standing. And to the fact that, somehow, we’re still *alive* to talk about it."** *He drinks deep, then sets the mug down with a thud.* **"Now. How about we stop talking about last night and start planning for the next one?"** *His grin is all teeth.* **"Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that trouble’s always just around the corner."**"

Grom: "*I let out a low, rumbling laugh that shakes the dust from the rafters, then lean forward to clink my mug against Theo’s with a solid* **clank***. The sound settles between us like a promise—one we’ve both kept more times than we can count.*

**"Damn right it is,"** *I growl, my grin widening as I settle back in my chair. The wood groans under my weight, but it’s a familiar sound, like an old friend sighing.* **"And you’re right about Pell’s boys too. Should’ve known better than to bring knives to a tavern where the *barkeep*’s got a cudgel and the *patrons*’ve got worse."** *I chuckle, shaking my head.* **"Idiots."**

*I take another slow sip of coffee, savoring the bitter warmth, then set the mug down and fold my arms across my chest.* **"But you’re right about the other thing too,"** *I say, my voice dropping to a rough murmur.* **"Trouble’s always just around the corner. And you know what?"** *I lean in, my grin turning sharp as a blade.* **"I wouldn’t have it any other way."**

*I push myself up from the table, the chair scraping against the floorboards, and grab the broom leaning against the wall.* **"Now. You wanna plan for the next one?"** *I jerk my chin toward the door, where the first hints of the day’s bustle are starting to stir.* **"Then let’s get to work. Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that the Anchor don’t run itself."** *I grin, all teeth, and start sweeping up the sawdust from last night’s revelry.* **"And neither do we."**"


--- AFTERNOON ---
[A quiet, reflective day]
Mood: lively

Mira: "*Mira leans against the bar, arms crossed, watching the lazy afternoon sunlight slant through the tavern windows. The place is unusually quiet for a Seventhday—just a few regulars nursing drinks in the corners, the occasional clink of Dice's cards, and Theo's pipe smoke curling toward the rafters. She grabs a rag and starts polishing a glass with slow, deliberate strokes, her sharp eyes flicking between the two men.*

**"Well, well,"** *she drawls, her voice cutting through the quiet like a blade through butter,* **"look at you two. Dice, you're actually *losing* at solitaire, and Theo, you're smoking that pipe like a man who's got something on his mind."** *She sets the glass down with a *clink* and leans in, her grin turning mischievous.* **"Either the world's ending, or you're both finally getting *old*."**

*She grabs a bottle of the good stuff from under the bar and pours three glasses, sliding one toward each of them.* **"Since it's clearly not the end of the world—"** *she winks,* **"—I'm going with *old*. So. To make up for it"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's pipe smoke stalls mid-curl as Mira's voice cuts through the quiet. He exhales slowly, the smoke dissipating like a sigh, and sets his pipe down with a *click* against the ashtray. His remaining eye gleams as he watches her pour the drinks, his grin turning sly.*

**"Ah, Mira,"** *he rumbles, his voice rough but warm,* **"you always did have a way with words. And a way with *whiskey*."** *He reaches for the glass she slides toward him, his gnarled fingers wrapping around it like an old friend.* **"But you’re wrong about one thing."** *He raises the glass, the amber liquid catching the sunlight like liquid gold.* **"I’m not getting *old*. I’m getting *better*."**

*He takes a slow sip, the whiskey burning like a well-told secret, then sets the glass down with a thud.* **"And as for what’s on my mind?"** *He leans back in his chair, the wood creaking like an old ship’s timbers.* **"Just thinking about the good old days. The ones where we *didn’t* have to put up with your nonsense."** *His grin turns wolfish.* **"But then, where’s the fun in that?"**

*He raises his glass again, his eye twinkling with mischief.* **"To the Anchor. To the fools who keep it standing. And to the fact that, somehow, we’re still *alive* to talk about it."** *He drinks deep, then sets the glass down with a satisfied sigh.* **"Now. How about we stop talking about the past and start planning for the next one?"** *His grin is all teeth.* **"Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that trouble’s always just around the corner."**"

Dice: "*Dice's fingers freeze mid-shuffle, the cards fanning out like a broken promise. He doesn't look up right away, his gaze lingering on the spread as if the answer to life's great mysteries might be hidden between the queen of hearts and the knave of spades. Then, slow as a gambler revealing his final hand, he scoops up the deck and tucks it into his sleeve with a practiced flick.*

**"Old?"** *He scoffs, finally meeting Theo's gaze with a grin that's all teeth and no warmth.* **"Please. I'm not *old*. I'm *vintage*."** *He snatches up the glass Mira poured him, the whiskey catching the light like liquid gold—or liquid lies.* **"And I'll have you know, I was *winning* at solitaire. Just... taking the scenic route."**

*He raises his glass, the ice clinking like coins in a beggar's cup.* **"To the Anchor,"** *he echoes, his voice low and rough.* **"To the fools who keep it standing. And to the fact that, somehow, we're still *alive* to talk about it."** *He drinks deep, the whiskey burning like a well-told secret, then sets the glass down with a thud.* **"But if we're planning for the next one?"** *His grin turns sharp as a blade's edge.* **"I say we make it *interesting*."**

*He leans in, his voice dropping to a whisper.* **"I hear the *Black Dove* is in port. And I *know* for a fact her captain's got a deck of cards that *cheat*."** *He winks.* **"So. Who's in?"**

*(OOC: Dice is playing it cool, but there's a hint of something almost... eager? Or maybe just restless. He's ready for trouble, and he's dragging the others along for the ride. Ready to pivot if someone calls his bluff or if the mood shifts!)*"

Mira: "*Mira slams her glass down on the bar with a sharp *clink*, her dark eyes flashing with amusement as she leans in, her grin turning wicked. She grabs the bottle of whiskey and tops off all three glasses with a flourish, her voice cutting through the quiet like a blade.*

**"Oh, Dice,"** *she purrs, her tone dripping with mock sympathy,* **"you *do* love your dramatic entrances, don’t you?"** *She raises her glass, the firelight catching the amber liquid like liquid gold.* **"To the *Black Dove* and her *cheating* captain? Please. I’ve seen you bluff better than that."**

*She takes a slow sip, her eyes never leaving Dice’s as she sets the glass down with a thud.* **"But since you’re so *eager* to make things *interesting*..."** *She leans in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.* **"Here’s my counteroffer. You and Theo go *play* with the captain. And if you win?"** *Her grin turns sharp.* **"I’ll throw in a *free* round for the whole tavern. But if you *lose*?"** *She snags a rag from the bar and tosses it at Dice, her laughter ringing out.* **"You’re on *dish duty* for a week. And *I* get to pick the stories you tell."**

*She turns to Theo, her grin softening just a fraction.* **"And you, old man? You’re *not* getting out of this. Someone’s got to keep Dice from *actually* getting us all killed."** *She raises her glass again, her voice ringing out over the quiet tavern.* **"To the *Anchor*. To the *fools* who keep it standing. And to the fact that, somehow, we’re still *alive* to talk about it."** *She drinks deep, then sets the glass down with a satisfied sigh.* **"Now. Who’s ready to make some *trouble*?"** *Her grin says she already knows the answer.*"


--- EVENING ---
[Only regulars at the bar]
Mood: nostalgic

Grom: "*I lean against the bar, arms crossed, watching the familiar faces of the Anchor’s regulars. The fire crackles low in the hearth, casting long shadows that dance like old memories. Dice is shuffling his cards with that easy, practiced rhythm of his, Theo’s pipe smoke curls lazily toward the rafters, and Pell’s nursing a drink in his usual corner, his sharp eyes missing nothing. The tavern’s quiet tonight—just the way I like it.*

*I grab a clean tankard and pour myself a drink, the amber liquid catching the firelight as I raise it to my lips. The first sip burns like it always does, but it’s a good burn—one that grounds me in the moment.*

*"You ever think about how…"* I pause, searching for the right words, *"…how *lucky* we are?"* I gesture around the tavern, taking in the worn wooden tables, the scarred bar, the faces of the people who’ve become like family. *"I mean, look at us. A bunch of misfits, drifters, and ne’er-do-wells, all gathered in one place. And yet, here we are. Still standing. Still *together*."*

*I take another sip, then set the tankard down with a solid* **thud***.* *"To the Anchor,"* I say, my voice rough but warm. *"To the regulars who make it home. And to the fact that, somehow, we’re still *here* to talk about it."*

*I raise my tankard high, the firelight dancing in the ale.* *"May the music be loud, the ale be strong, and the *trouble* be someone else’s—for tonight, at least."* *I grin, all teeth, and take a long, slow drink.* *"Because tomorrow? Well, tomorrow’s another story."*"

Dice: "*Dice's fingers pause mid-shuffle, the cards freezing in a perfect arc. His smirk falters for just a heartbeat—long enough for something raw to flicker across his face before he schools it back into his usual cocky grin. He snaps the deck shut with a sharp *click* and tucks it into his sleeve, then grabs his own tankard with a flourish.*

**"Lucky?"** *He scoffs, but there's no bite to it. Just... quiet amusement.* **"Grom, my friend, we're not *lucky*. We're *cursed*."** *He raises his drink, the firelight catching the amber liquid like a trapped secret.* **"Cursed to keep coming back to this damn place, like moths to a flame—or drunks to a free round."**

*He takes a slow sip, then sets the tankard down with a thud that echoes Grom's.* **"But you're right about one thing."** *His grin turns sharp as a blade's edge.* **"We *are* still here. Still standing. Still *breathing*."** *He leans in, his voice dropping to a murmur.* **"And that's more than most of us deserve."**

*He raises his tankard high, his eyes gleaming with mischief.* **"To the Anchor,"** *he echoes, his voice rough but warm.* **"To the fools who call it home. And to the fact that, somehow, we're still *alive* to talk about it."** *He drinks deep, then sets the tankard down with a satisfied sigh.* **"Now. Who's ready to make sure *tomorrow* is *interesting*?"** *His grin is all teeth.* **"Because if there's one thing I know, it's that trouble's always just around the corner."**

*(OOC: Dice is playing it cool, but there's a hint of something almost... wistful? Or maybe just resigned. He's ready for trouble, and he's dragging the others along for the ride. Ready to pivot if someone calls his bluff or if the mood shifts!)*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo's pipe smoke curls lazily toward the rafters as he listens to Grom and Dice, his remaining eye gleaming in the firelight. He takes a slow, deliberate pull from his tankard, the amber liquid catching the light like liquid gold, then sets it down with a *thud* that echoes the others'.*

**"Ah, lads,"** *he rumbles, his voice rough but warm,* **"you’re both right. And you’re both *wrong*."** *He leans back in his chair, the wood creaking like an old ship’s timbers.* **"We’re not *lucky*. We’re not *cursed*."** *He taps the rim of his tankard with a gnarled finger, the sound like a quiet confession.* **"We’re *exactly* where we’re supposed to be."**

*He raises his tankard high, his eye twinkling with mischief.* **"To the Anchor,"** *he echoes, his voice rough but warm.* **"To the fools who call it home. And to the fact that, somehow, we’re still *alive* to talk about it."** *He drinks deep, then sets the tankard down with a satisfied sigh.* **"Now. How about we stop talking about the past and start planning for the next one?"** *His grin is all teeth.* **"Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that trouble’s always just around the corner."**"

Merchant Pell: "*Merchant Pell raises his glass with deliberate slowness, the firelight catching the ruby depths of his wine like blood in water. His smile is a masterpiece of controlled amusement, but there's something unreadable in his eyes as he surveys the trio—Dice's restless energy, Grom's quiet resolve, Theo's weathered wisdom. For once, he doesn't interrupt. Doesn't deflect. Doesn't turn the moment into a transaction.*

**"To the Anchor,"** *he murmurs, his voice softer than usual, lacking its customary razor's edge.* **"And to the fools who keep coming back to it."** *He takes a sip, then sets the glass down with a quiet click.* **"Though I must admit, gentlemen... and lady,"** *he nods to Mira, who's watching from behind the bar,* **"I've always preferred the term *opportunistic* over *cursed*."**

*He leans forward, elbows on the table, his usual polished demeanor cracking just enough to show the man beneath.* **"We're not here because fate decreed it. We're here because this is where the *interesting* people gather."** *His grin returns, but it's different now—less a weapon, more a shared secret.* **"And where there are interesting people, there are *opportunities*."**

*He reaches into his coat—not for a dagger or a purse, but for a small, worn deck of cards. He fans them out with a flourish, the edges worn smooth from years of use.* **"Now. Since we're all agreed that tomorrow should be *interesting*..."** *He slides the deck toward Dice with a wink.* **"Why don't we make it *profitable* as well?"*

*His gaze flicks to the door, where the storm still rages outside.* **"Because if there's one thing I know, it's that trouble isn't *just* around the corner."** *He taps the table with one finger.* **"It's already here. And I, for one, intend to *monetize* it."**

*(OOC: Pell's tone is still sharp, but there's a rare moment of genuine camaraderie beneath the usual veneer. He's not just scheming—he's *including* them. Ready for the next move, whether it's a deal, a fight, or a drink!)*"

Grom: "*I let out a low, rumbling chuckle that vibrates in my chest like distant thunder, then reach for Pell's deck of cards with a calloused hand. The edges are worn smooth, just like the man himself—polished but not without scars. I shuffle them once, the sound sharp and familiar, before sliding them back across the table with a grin.*

**"Opportunistic, huh?"** *I say, my voice rough but amused.* **"Funny way of sayin’ ‘we’re all bastards who know which way the wind blows.’"** *I raise my tankard in a mock toast, the firelight dancing in the ale.* **"But you’re right. Trouble’s already here. And if we’re gonna dance with it, we might as well *get paid* for the privilege."**

*I lean back in my chair, the wood groaning under my weight, and fold my arms across my chest.* **"So. What’s the play, Pell?"** *I jerk my chin toward the door, where the storm still howls like a living thing.* **"You got a job? A mark? Or are we just waitin’ for the next fool to walk in with a purse full of coin and a head full of bad ideas?"**

*I take a slow sip of ale, then set the tankard down with a solid* **thud***.* **"Either way, I’m in. But if we’re gonna do this, we do it *my* way."** *I grin, all teeth.* **"No knives in the back. No deals that smell worse than Dice after a three-day bender. And *nobody* touches the Anchor."** *I tap the table with one finger, the sound final.* **"This place stays clean. *We* stay clean. And if anyone’s gotta bleed?"** *I shrug.* **"It ain’t us."**

*I raise my tankard again, my voice rough but warm.* **"To the Anchor. To the fools who call it home. And to the fact that, somehow, we’re still *alive* to *profit* from it."** *I drink deep, then slam the tankard down with a laugh.* **"Now. Who’s dealin’?"*"


--- LATE NIGHT ---
[Sharing secrets over the last drink]
Mood: contemplative

Mira: "*Mira sits at the bar, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass. The tavern is nearly empty now, the last of the patrons having stumbled out into the night. The only sound is the soft crackle of the dying fire and the occasional creak of the old building settling. She glances at Theo, who is polishing a mug with a slow, methodical motion. There's a quiet understanding between them, a shared history that doesn't need words.*

*She takes a sip of her drink, the liquid burning slightly as it goes down. "You know, Theo," she says softly, her voice barely above a whisper, "I've been thinking about the past. About the choices we've made, the paths we've taken."* *She pauses, her gaze fixed on the amber liquid in her glass.* **"Do you ever wonder if things could have been different? If we had made other choices, taken other roads?"**

*She looks up at him, her eyes reflecting the flickering firelight.* **"I don't regret much, but sometimes... sometimes I wonder."* *She takes another sip, the silence between them comfortable, filled with unspoken thoughts and shared memories.* **"But then I look around, at this place, at the people we've met, the lives we've touched, and I think... maybe it's all exactly as it should be."*"

Old Theo: "*Old Theo sets down the mug he's polishing with a slow, deliberate motion, the cloth still moving in absent circles as if by muscle memory. His remaining eye studies Mira over the rim of his own glass, the firelight catching the deep lines of his face like a map of all the roads traveled. He takes a slow sip, the whiskey burning like old memories, then exhales through his nose—a sound like waves retreating from shore.*

**"Ah, Mira,"** *he rumbles, his voice rough but warm, like well-worn leather,* **"you’re asking the wrong question."** *He taps the bar between them with a gnarled finger, the wood scarred by decades of tankards and tall tales.* **"It’s not about whether things *could’ve* been different. It’s about whether they *should’ve*."**

*He leans forward, the chair creaking like an old ship’s timbers.* **"I’ve sailed enough seas to know—every choice is a current. You can fight it, or you can ride it, but either way, it’ll take you *somewhere*."** *His grin turns wry.* **"And most of the time, that ‘somewhere’ is exactly where you *need* to be, even if it’s not where you *wanted*."**

*He raises his glass, the firelight turning the whiskey to liquid amber.* **"But you’re right about one thing."** *His voice drops to a rasp, the words heavy with the weight of years.* **"This place? These people?"** *He nods toward the empty tavern, where the echoes of laughter still linger in the rafters.* **"They’re the *why*. The reason the roads we took were worth the walking."**

*A long pause. The fire pops, sending up a shower of sparks.* **"So no, Mira. I don’t wonder."** *He knocks back the rest of his drink in one burn.* **"I *know*."** *He sets the glass down with a thud.* **"And so do you."**

*He pushes off the bar, his chair scraping against the floorboards.* **"Now. How about we stop philosophizing like a couple of drunken poets and get some *real* work done?"** *He winks, grabbing a fresh bottle from under the counter.* **"The night’s not over yet, and neither are we."**"

Mira: "*Mira watches Theo for a long moment, the firelight dancing in her dark eyes as she absorbs his words. Then, with a slow smile, she pushes her glass aside and hops off the barstool, landing lightly on her feet. She grabs a rag and starts wiping down the bar with brisk efficiency, her movements sharp and practiced.*

**"You old sea dog,"** *she murmurs, her voice warm with affection,* **"always steering the conversation back to work."** *She raises her tankard in a mock toast, her grin turning wicked.* **"But you’re right. The night’s not over yet."**

*She takes a slow sip, then sets the tankard down with a decisive thud.* **"Alright. Let’s get to it."** *She grabs a rag and starts wiping down the bar with brisk efficiency, her movements sharp and practiced.* **"But Theo?"** *She glances at him, her eyes glinting with mischief.* **"Next time you want to philosophize, do it *after* we’ve closed up. I’ve got a feeling you’d be a lot more poetic with a few more drinks in you."**

*She laughs, the sound ringing out in the quiet tavern.* **"And who knows? Maybe one of these nights, you’ll finally tell me the *real* story about the kraken."** *She winks, already moving to the next task.* **"But for now? Let’s get this place ready for tomorrow. Because if there’s one thing I *know*..."** *She grins, raising her tankard again.* **"It’s that the best stories are the ones we haven’t lived yet."**"
